# Binary Files

These are various compiled binary files, representing the latest
version of various *nzilbb.ag* components.

These include:
* nzilbb.ag.jar - the primary API/object model for nzilbb.ag
* vtt-to-textgrid.jar - a program that converted WebVTT caption files
to Praat TextGrids

To run *vtt-to-textgrid.jar*, you need to have Java installed on your
system. Download the file, and double-click it to run.

If double-clicking doesn't work, you can run the converter from the
command line, by entering:
```
java -jar vtt-to-textgrid.jar
```
