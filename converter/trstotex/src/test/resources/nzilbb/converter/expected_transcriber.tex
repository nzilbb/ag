\turn{mop03-2b}{and ah . Cyril would arrive at the door\\
with this letter for Mum\\
and and then there was a message .\\
and I think they both had telephones .\\
ah at that time\\
we certainly had a telephone at our place --\\
and I think Molly always had a telephone so .\\
then I suppose\\
there was a phone call to say\\
oh yeah yeah and we'll see you there\\
or whatever \textless mmm\textgreater  you know -\\
but then Molly walked in .\\
and immediately I grabbed Molly\\
because I knew se she was so close .\\
and I told her all about it .\\
\textless yeah\textgreater  and ah -\\
ah . and I said come quick come quick .\\
Dad's at home\\
and he's a hell of a mess\\
\textless yeah\textgreater  sort of words you know ? \textless yeah\textgreater \\
which he was he was beside himself}

\turn{Interviewer}{well inconsolable I imagine}

\turn{mop03-2b}{he was you know -- so -\\
I don't know how we got back there\\
whether we got a taxi or .\\
the priests ran us up .\\
you know because .\\
the township's quite a long from where we lived in --\\
and ah -- shit --\\
and I remember -\\
she came home and tried to console Dad and -\\
he said oh she's just cooked me a cake\\
for my fiftieth birthday\\
which was on the bench \textless mmm\textgreater  -\\
and um --\\
at a certain stage .\\
I had to go .\\
the same night I think\\
after I'd seen Molly\\
I think she went -\\
to my to our place\\
to k try to find .\\
pop and . console him --\\
and I . had to go back with the police .\\
to . to um --\\
to identify Mum - \textless right\textgreater  -\\
and um --\\
and that was very difficult -}

\turn{Interviewer}{yeah --}

\turn{mop03-2b}{but later I got back home .\\
and I remember --\\
Molly had gone and Dad was --\\
there but s you know . very -\\
depressed as shit and so on -\\
and Barry was just coming back from -\\
camp he was at Ohakia . as a -\\
he was in the . air force -\\
at that time .\\
he did air force training as an eighteen year old and .\\
he . he was there -\\
and he arrived back -\\
with one of his friends .\\
and I remember going out to the . front -\\
ah of the house\\
beside the garage\\
and of course you know he'd just come in .\\
to Wanganui and .\\
didn't know a bloody thing\\
and I said to him\\
Barry Barry come in .\\
Dad wants to talk to you --\\
and so his friend said oh . well .\\
oh see you later you know and .\\
rode away on his bike or whatever he had .\\
a motorbike or something -\\
or a car -\\
and of course . you know .\\
it was just Barry and I\\
there were no other children at that time - \textless mmm\textgreater  --\\
so he came in and - --\\
learned all the . disaster --}

\turn{Interviewer}{goodness}

\turn{mop03-2b}{and have you got all that ?\textit{[both laugh]} }

\turn{Interviewer}{well the funny light hasn't gone on -\\
again}

\turn{mop03-2b}{did you switch it off or what ?}

\turn{Interviewer}{well I turned it over --\\
I thought it might be something to do with\\
where it was on the tape}

\turn{mop03-2b}{I must go and have a leak you know\\
if you'll excuse me}

\turn{Interviewer}{okay --\\
see if I can figure out what that light was}

\turn{mop03-2b}{well I think you should .\\
listen to it because o\\
very often when you're recording -\\
if you don't listen to them pretty quickly\\
you bloody find out\\
that the microphone is malfunctioning}

\turn{Interviewer}{yeah yeah yeah -- well that's right}

\turn{mop03-2b}{or some and there's nothing much on it or\\
now where is it in the back left ?}

\turn{Interviewer}{ah yeah just turn left there\textit{[cough]} \\
}

\turn{mop03-2b}{that - Mum and Dad had looked at a house.\\
in the country --\\
on the main road which\\
was driving towards Taranaki --\\
and it was a . country house -\\
with a long drive in\\
you know over the field and .\\
into the house . and .\\
and I'd said to Barry once or twice gosh .\\
if they'd bought that house --\\
when they first looked at it -\\
she'd still be alive today\\
because well this is years ago\\
of course I made these comments -\\
because . that would have removed .\\
her from the danger that was present on that .\\
main road Somme parade \textless hm\textgreater \\
well it wasn't a main road it was --\\
a feeder road --\\
ah and we'd have all lived in the country and .\\
ah well not that it wa\~{} \\
you know it wasn't that far out -\\
it was up by Virginia Lake .\\
I don't know whether you know Wanganui much but}

\turn{Interviewer}{I don't really know it at all\\
--\\
so after all that you said that .\\
you said that .\\
grandpop didn't let you.\\
like he kept the family together - how}

\turn{mop03-2b}{oh well . he . of course people .\\
al\~{}  always come forward.\\
and offer to take .\\
some of the children}
