*INT:	Before we move to the first question to the First Minister, I invite the First Minister 1849_6430
	to make a few remarks following the tragic events in Christchurch in New Zealand. 6430_9879
	The First Minister (Nicola Sturgeon): Thank you, Presiding Officer. I begin today 9879_13600
	with heartfelt condolences to the people of New Zealand after last week’s appalling 13600_18450
	terrorist attack in Christchurch. I hope that people in New Zealand can take some comfort 18450_24010
	from the knowledge that people across the world stand in solidarity with them. 24010_28740
	Events in New Zealand have been felt deeply here in Scotland, as in other countries, and 28740_34000
	perhaps especially in our Muslim community. Last week, Police Scotland arranged reassurance 34000_39649
	patrols and visits to mosques and other places of worship. On Friday, I visited Glasgow central 39649_44979
	mosque with the justice secretary. 44979_48159
	The Prime Minister of New Zealand has said that nations around the world are engaged 48159_53089
	in a global fight against far-right, racist and extremist ideology. Regrettably, she is 53089_59889
	absolutely right. All of us have a responsibility to engage in that fight. We must tackle hatred 59889_66850
	and prejudice through the words that we use, the actions that we take and the climate that 66850_71729
	we create. I know that all parties in this chamber will play their part in doing that. 71729_76619
	In the past week, we have also seen an attack in Utrecht and the stabbing of a teenager 76619_81969
	in Surrey. Our condolences are with all those who have been affected by those incidents 81969_86420
	as well. 86420_87579
	Let us today express sympathy and solidarity with the victims of racist and extremist violence 87579_93060
	in Christchurch and around the world. Above all, let us make clear our determination that 93060_99310
	the proponents of hate will be defeated by the values of kindness, compassion and love. 99310_107340
	[Applause.] 107340_109560
	The Presiding Officer: We turn to questions to the First Minister, 109560_117710
	the first of which is from Jackson Carlaw. 117710_118710
	Jackson Carlaw (Eastwood) (Con): I associate all of us in the Scottish Conservatives 118710_123719
	with the First Minister’s remarks and offer our support for any measures that are required 123719_128030
	to reassure those who attend mosques in Scotland. 128030_132620
	Many Scots will have friends and family who live in or regularly visit New Zealand and 132620_137420
	who will have been deeply affected. However, for many in Scotland’s Muslim community, 137420_141670
	events on the other side of the world must never have felt closer to home. As we embrace 141670_146250
	them with our good wishes and condolences, we must—as the First Minister said—work 146250_150090
	together to think afresh about what must be done by us all to counter this defining 21st 150090_156280
	century scourge. 156280_159750
	Over the past 10 years, the Scottish National Party Government has launched two major drug 159750_163360
	strategies. Tragically, during those 10 years drug deaths have doubled. We are now on course 163360_169110
	to have the largest number of drug deaths per head anywhere in Europe. Does the First 169110_174590
	Minister believe that the strategies have been a success or a failure? 174590_178360
	The First Minister (Nicola Sturgeon): These are challenging issues and I readily 178360_182680
	concede that this Government—any Government—must remain open to fresh thinking and new ideas. 182680_190230
	The situation with regard to drug deaths is not one that any of us would consider to be 190230_196090
	acceptable. However, as I said in the chamber last week, many of those who have died have 196090_203840
	lived with alcohol and drug use for a long time—such people become more vulnerable 203840_208200
	as they grow older as a result of their complex health and social needs. Although I do not 208200_215920
	overstate the point, more encouraging is the fact that the last report showed fewer deaths 215920_220080
	among the under-25 population. Recent reports also highlight falling heroin use—again, 220080_226630
	particularly among under-25s. 226630_227680
	As I am sure that Jackson Carlaw is aware, work is under way in Dundee and Glasgow to 227680_234090
	consider what more can be done to tackle drug deaths. That work will be of relevance around 234090_239690
	Scotland, but we want to see the outcomes from it before we consider what further action 239690_244300
	we should take. 244300_246210
	Jackson Carlaw: We all want to sort the crisis, but the first 246210_250920
	step is surely to admit that the current policy is not working as it should. Regrettably, 250920_255330
	it has been a failure. I have an example of that. 255330_258190
	We know that rehabilitation services in prisons can be vital in turning around people’s 258190_262810
	lives. However, my colleague Adam Tomkins has discovered in recent days that in Barlinnie, 262810_266280
	which is one of our biggest prisons, a successful voluntary project—a recovery cafe where 266280_272090
	people can go to get their lives back on track—is facing closure. How can it be right that we 272090_278200
	prioritise spending millions of pounds on methadone programmes, yet successful projects 278200_284730
	such as the cafe are put at risk? 284730_286080
	The First Minister: First, I say to Jackson Carlaw and to Adam 286080_293400
	Tomkins that the justice secretary has received a letter on the issue, which will be responded 293400_298490
	to in due course. 298490_299570
	It is important that I advise members that the Scottish Government has not previously 299570_304600
	funded recovery cafes. However, we provide funding for the Scottish Recovery Consortium, 304600_311560
	and the Scottish Prison Service adopts a therapeutic approach in dealing with addiction issues 311560_316830
	and provides support for those with addiction problems who are in their care. 316830_320790
	The new alcohol and drug strategy highlights the importance of recovery communities and 320790_325240
	the need for them to be at the heart of any proposals. They help to reduce stigma, because 325240_330850
	they provide the visible face of recovery, as well as insights into addiction and harm. 330850_336190
	Through our sustained funding of the Scottish Recovery Consortium, we will continue to do 336190_341010
	what we can to support the growth of recovery communities across the country. 341010_344900
	We will of course give consideration to the points that Adam Tomkins made in his letter. 344900_350910
	Jackson Carlaw: My question was not intended as a criticism 350910_353400
	of that mix of approaches. 353400_354400
	Just a few miles from Parliament is Castle Craig hospital near West Linton, which is 354400_357670
	a drug rehabilitation centre with capacity for residential drug rehab patients, and which 357670_362590
	the Conservative health spokesman, Miles Briggs, visited recently. Hospital staff told him 362590_365320
	that Castle Craig is not receiving national health service referrals and is mostly kept 365320_369970
	going by patients who are referred from the Netherlands for treatment. Is not the First 369970_375441
	Minister, like me, concerned that Dutch patients are getting better access to that rehabilitation 375441_381080
	project here in Scotland than local Scots who are in need of the same support and treatment? 381080_385930
	The First Minister: I am very happy to look into that specific 385930_391840
	example. We want people to have access to a broad range of rehabilitation services. 391840_401050
	The Scottish Government is providing £70 million this financial year to reduce the 401050_406410
	harms that are caused by alcohol and drugs. That includes an additional £20 million for 406410_412750
	drug and alcohol services, which is being allocated to support new approaches, so that 412750_417150
	we respond in a much more joined-up and person-centred way. Such investment is important. 417150_427000
	I am not trying to make a party-political point about a very serious issue, but it is 427000_431160
	also important that we are prepared to take forward innovative and evidence-based new 431160_436460
	approaches, even if at first they seem to be challenging, particularly for public opinion. 436460_442790
	That is why we supported the principles behind Glasgow’s proposals for a medically supervised 442790_447980
	safer drug consumption facility and heroin-assisted treatment in the city. It is important that 447980_453230
	we work with health and social care partnerships on new approaches, as well as ensuring that 453230_458360
	we invest in rehabilitation. I hope that the Conservatives will think about giving us support 458360_463620
	on that, because we need to persuade the United Kingdom Government to do what is required. 463620_468230
	Jackson Carlaw: I respect the First Minister’s approach 468230_471680
	to that policy. We have looked at it, but, unfortunately, it is the one policy in this 471680_474669
	area on which we fundamentally disagree. We think that the policy should be to get people 474669_478810
	clean of drugs, not to provide opportunities for people to take them. 478810_482870
	Scottish Conservatives have set out a clear plan to tackle Scotland’s growing drugs 482870_487870
	crisis, which is to get first-time offenders into treatment, direct more money into rehabilitation 487870_492699
	programmes run by third sector bodies and, at the same time, at least review the failed 492699_498900
	methadone programme. 498900_499900
	Let us admit that, in politics at the moment, we are not overrun with issues on which we 499900_506240
	can form consensus. However, on this one vital issue, will the First Minister commit today 506240_511630
	to working across the chamber—we will commit to that—to improve the drugs strategy for 511630_515990
	the next 10 years, so that we can cut drug deaths and drug addiction and come down hard 515990_522159
	on those peddling misery in our communities? 522159_524529
	The First Minister: I reiterate my willingness to work across 524529_530810
	the chamber. I think that I have said in a couple of my responses today that I will consider 530810_535600
	the points that Jackson Carlaw has raised, and I give that reassurance again. I ask for 535600_540589
	the same in return. I am slightly concerned at the almost knee-jerk way in which Jackson 540589_546480
	Carlaw ruled out the fresh thinking around safer drug consumption facilities. If we are 546480_552459
	genuinely to try and find a consensus, we have to be open to new thinking, and that 552459_557040
	will sometimes be very tough and challenging. I appeal to Jackson Carlaw to reconsider his 557040_563189
	opposition to that policy, just as he is asking me to be open-minded to any proposals that 563189_567170
	he makes. 567170_568290
	We will continue to ensure that we have the right strategies in place to deal with what 568290_573110
	we all accept is a challenging and complex issue. First, that involves taking a very 573110_578360
	hard line against those who supply drugs—and we saw figures earlier this week about police 578360_582660
	seizures of drugs. Secondly, it definitely involves support, particularly rehabilitation 582660_588720
	support, for those who are addicted to drugs. Thirdly, it involves being open to new ideas 588720_594249
	and new thinking. If we can all agree broadly around that approach, perhaps we can build 594249_599879
	a consensus that allows us to tackle something that we all agree is unacceptable. We want 599879_606139
	to see a considerably improved situation, and I hope that we have the support of Jackson 606139_610940
	Carlaw and the Conservatives on that. 610940_614839
	Richard Leonard (Central Scotland) (Lab): I add the deep-felt condolences of the Scottish 614839_620309
	Labour Party to the families and friends of all those who lost their lives in the terror 620309_625040
	attack in Christchurch last Friday. I offer our support for practical action to defeat 625040_633259
	racism and hatred wherever it occurs. 633259_638009
	To ask the First Minister why there is a staffing crisis in the national health service. 638009_643009
	The First Minister (Nicola Sturgeon): There is not a staffing crisis in the national 643009_647779
	health service. There are record numbers of people working in the national health service. 647779_652869
	In fact, I can tell Richard Leonard that staffing levels in NHS Scotland are now at a record 652869_660100
	high and are up by more than 13,600 since 2006, just before this Government took office. 660100_669709
	The number of consultants is up by 51 per cent; the number of qualified nurses and midwives 669709_675839
	is up by 8 per cent; and there is a higher level of NHS staffing per head in Scotland 675839_680540
	than there is in NHS England. 680540_682769
	Our NHS staff of course work under considerable pressure, and we are grateful to them for 682769_687929
	the job that they do, but we will continue to invest in our NHS to ensure that there 687929_692629
	are record numbers of staff, so that they can continue to deliver the excellent services 692629_697269
	that they do. 697269_698269
	Richard Leonard: This week, the Parliament’s Health and Sport 698269_703790
	Committee, following the tragic events at the Queen Elizabeth university hospital, began 703790_709019
	its inquiry into infection control standards. New figures released to Scottish Labour this 709019_715800
	week reveal that the number of domestic staff—that is, cleaners—who are employed at the Queen 715800_721220
	Elizabeth university hospital is falling. In March 2018, 464 cleaners were employed 721220_730480
	at the hospital. According to the latest figures, that number has dropped to 440. Why, at the 730480_739980
	very point when it is facing a rise in infection outbreaks, is Scotland’s biggest hospital 739980_747889
	employing fewer people on the front line whose job it is to keep that hospital clean and 747889_754379
	safe? 754379_755489
	The First Minister: I am sure that Richard Leonard will have heard 755489_760649
	the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport already address this issue publicly. The issue 760649_764730
	has been raised with Greater Glasgow and Clyde NHS Board. It is absolutely imperative that 764730_769699
	all health boards in all hospitals ensure appropriate numbers of domestic and cleaning 769699_774620
	staff. 774620_775620
	It is of course for health boards to consider the configuration of staffing. As Richard 775620_780670
	Leonard will know, and as those of us who represent Glasgow constituencies know particularly 780670_785279
	well, there has been a significant change in the configuration of Glasgow hospitals 785279_789470
	over the past number of years, and the overall staffing numbers will undoubtedly reflect 789470_794889
	that. 794889_797869
	We will continue to raise issues directly with health boards to ensure that they are 797869_802899
	addressed where that is necessary. Notwithstanding the very serious incidents at the Queen Elizabeth 802899_808130
	university hospital, which we have discussed on many occasions in the chamber before—and 808130_811759
	I welcome the Health and Sport Committee’s inquiry into these issues—infection rates 811759_816040
	are down considerably in Scottish hospitals overall. 816040_821319
	I see that Jackie Baillie is in the chamber. She and I regularly used to have exchanges 821319_827420
	about the levels of Clostridium difficile in our hospitals, following the tragic incident 827420_830949
	at the Vale of Leven hospital. C diff, MRSA and infections generally are down, in some 830949_835579
	cases by more than 80 per cent. 835579_838079
	Let us tackle issues where they arise—Richard Leonard is right to raise them—but let us 838079_843629
	not lose sight of the good work that has been done in our NHS to reduce infection and to 843629_848470
	put a real focus on patient safety. 848470_850949
	Richard Leonard: I should also make it clear that the problem 850949_855679
	is not unique to one hospital: it is replicated right across the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde 855679_861499
	area. There are fewer domestics, porters and laundry and linen staff compared with last 861499_868569
	year’s levels. It is clear that we have a staffing crisis in our health service, and 868569_873989
	that it is not confined to consultants, nurses and midwives but extends to facilities staff, 873989_879649
	domestics, catering workers, porters and laundry staff—all workers without whom no hospital 879649_887749
	can operate. 887749_890329
	We know that there is a parliamentary inquiry and that reviews are being carried out by 890329_894649
	the health board and the Government. However, these issues are serious and urgent. The public, 894649_902889
	and the staff who are under pressure, need to hear a commitment that the reduction in 902889_908519
	such vital front-line jobs will be reversed as soon as possible. Is the First Minister 908519_913949
	prepared to give them that commitment today? 913949_917029
	The First Minister: As I said earlier, we will continue to work 917029_921799
	with health boards, including NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, to ensure that they have 921799_924680
	appropriate staffing levels across all specialties in the NHS. That is important. I repeat what 924680_931779
	I have already said: record numbers of staff are working in our national health service. 931779_936389
	Richard Leonard says that the issues are urgent, and I could not agree more. I know how devastating 936389_941509
	outbreaks of infection in hospitals are—principally for patients and their families, but also 941509_945879
	for the staff who work there. That is why the Healthcare Environment Inspectorate’s 945879_951449
	report on the Queen Elizabeth university hospital, which was commissioned and instructed by the 951449_953889
	Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport, has already been completed, and why its recommendations 953889_959269
	have already been accepted by the health board and are being implemented. 959269_964800
	Whatever disagreements we might have, and whatever legitimate points Richard Leonard 964800_969429
	might raise—they are legitimate points—I do not think that anybody could doubt the 969429_973920
	seriousness of the Government and the health service when it comes to tackling infections 973920_979799
	in our hospitals. Overall, the figures state that things are going in the right direction, 979799_986100
	but that does not take away from the need to tackle serious incidents when they arise. 986100_990579
	We will continue to do exactly that. 990579_992670
	The Presiding Officer: We turn to constituency supplementary questions, 992670_996589
	the first of which is from Liam Kerr. 996589_998920
	Liam Kerr (North East Scotland) (Con): Cove harbour fishing community is suffering. 998920_1003259
	First, its landing was bought—and closed—by a private landlord. It went to court and won 1003259_1008179
	rights of public access but faced significant legal costs. Several boats were then destroyed 1008179_1012259
	in a fire, and now the landlord has closed access to the beach. Community representatives 1012259_1016069
	have written to the Cabinet Secretary for the Rural Economy, Fergus Ewing, several times, 1016069_1018829
	requesting a meeting—even if that were to be here at Holyrood—to discuss their rights 1018829_1022759
	and their future, but to no avail. 1022759_1024530
	Will the First Minister ask the cabinet secretary to meet those representatives, and not risk 1024530_1028648
	ignoring a community that faces the loss of its livelihood? 1028648_1030799
	The First Minister (Nicola Sturgeon): Of course, the Scottish Government wants to 1030799_1034579
	do everything possible to help any community that is experiencing difficulties. Beyond 1034579_1040398
	what the member has just said, I am not aware of the content of the correspondence with 1040398_1043109
	Fergus Ewing, but I am happy to give an undertaking to look into that and, if the cabinet secretary 1043109_1047829
	thinks that the Scottish Government can offer help, for him to meet those who are affected. 1047829_1051730
	Dr Alasdair Allan (Na h-Eileanan an Iar) (SNP): Earlier this week, the Office of Gas and Electricity 1051730_1057530
	Markets announced that it was minded to reject proposals for a 600MW transmission link to 1057530_1062649
	the Western Isles, saying that it would instead support a much-reduced 450MW link. That has 1062649_1068970
	been met with extreme disappointment in my constituency, because it will severely constrain 1068970_1072990
	capacity for future community projects and place other existing projects from the Western 1072990_1076920
	Isles at a potential disadvantage. 1076920_1079590
	What pressure can the Scottish Government put on Ofgem, and the United Kingdom Government, 1079590_1083940
	to reconsider that short-sighted decision? 1083940_1084940
	The First Minister (Nicola Sturgeon): The Scottish Government is absolutely committed 1084940_1089549
	to unlocking the vast renewables potential of our islands and the associated economic 1089549_1094669
	benefits for our island communities. We are very concerned at the uncertainty over the 1094669_1099190
	proposed connection from the Western Isles. The Government believes that for the islands’ 1099190_1103620
	full renewables potential to be realised, a larger link is required, so I very much 1103620_1108669
	agree with the sentiment of Alasdair Allan’s question. We have made arguments directly 1108669_1113101
	to Ofgem to support that point, and we will continue to do so as we engage further with 1113101_1118010
	it and with island stakeholders and developers during the on-going consultation process. 1118010_1123929
	I assure Alasdair Allan—and the chamber—that we will make absolutely every effort to secure 1123929_1129100
	the right outcome for the Western Isles. 1129100_1131500
	Jackie Baillie (Dumbarton) (Lab): The First Minister will be aware that my constituent 1131500_1137450
	Jagtar Singh Johal has spent more than 500 days detained in prison in the Punjab. There 1137450_1143299
	have been accusations of torture and he has now faced his 77th pre-trial preliminary hearing. 1143299_1149690
	His MP, Martin Docherty-Hughes, is to be commended for pursuing the matter vigorously. 1149690_1155350
	Will the First Minister use her influence and speak to the Foreign Secretary and the 1155350_1159919
	United Kingdom Government to urge them to provide support and assistance to Mr Johal 1159919_1164519
	and his family? 1164519_1165519
	The First Minister (Nicola Sturgeon): I thank Jackie Baillie for raising this issue. 1165519_1168929
	I know that she has raised it previously and she is right to say that Martin Docherty-Hughes 1168929_1174750
	MP has been assiduous in raising the rights and situation of his constituent. 1174750_1179929
	We have raised this issue and we will continue to do so. The Deputy First Minister has raised 1179929_1183880
	it directly with Indian ministers on recent visits to India and with the British high 1183880_1190730
	commission. I believe—although I will double-check this—that we have raised the issue directly 1190730_1195390
	with the Foreign Office. If not, I am happy to undertake that we will do so. 1195390_1202450
	Miles Briggs (Lothian) (Con): In recent weeks, I have received correspondence 1202450_1205880
	from families across Scotland who are facing unacceptable waits for cleft surgery. Two 1205880_1210191
	years ago, we warned Scottish National Party ministers about the impact of the closure 1210191_1213880
	of the Edinburgh unit and the centralisation of cleft services. This Parliament voted against 1213880_1218929
	centralisation, but ministers pressed on against the will of Parliament. 1218929_1222870
	One case highlighted to me just this week is that of a young man who has been waiting 1222870_1226820
	two years for a promised final surgery and is no further forward on when he will receive 1226820_1232170
	that. Families are also telling me that they are looking to NHS England in order to receive 1232170_1236440
	the surgery. Will the First Minister apologise to families for those waits? What will she 1236440_1241070
	do to correct the mistake that this Government made? 1241070_1243880
	The First Minister (Nicola Sturgeon): As I have said many times before in the chamber, 1243880_1246960
	I regret it when any patient has to wait longer for treatment than we would want to be the 1246960_1252740
	case. 1252740_1253740
	On the issue of cleft surgery, as I recall, the redesign of that service was on clinical 1253740_1258980
	grounds, to ensure a quality and safe service. If Miles Briggs would like to give further 1258980_1265470
	details of the constituents who are raising issues with him, the Cabinet Secretary for 1265470_1268610
	Health and Sport will look into those and, once she has had the opportunity to do that, 1268610_1273659
	will correspond further with him. 1273659_1276200
	Patrick Harvie (Glasgow) (Green): On behalf of the Scottish Greens, I join others 1276200_1281200
	in expressing our shared concern for the bereaved and injured following the far-right terrorist 1281200_1288169
	attack in New Zealand, but also our respect for the response that that country is showing, 1288169_1295000
	recommitting to the values of its inclusive society and refusing to placate the far right, 1295000_1302039
	as far too many politicians around the world have done. 1302039_1307600
	Last night, in the midst of a crisis of her own making, the Prime Minister again refused 1307600_1312779
	to listen to reason and instead effectively told the public that Parliament is their enemy. 1312779_1320480
	Scotland needs the freedom to take a different direction, leave behind this chaos and find 1320480_1326750
	our own way out of the crisis. That is why we need our independence. The First Minister 1326750_1333029
	told us that she would say something about her preferred timing within weeks. That was 1333029_1338279
	two months ago. I ask again, when? 1338279_1343159
	The First Minister (Nicola Sturgeon): First, I agree with Patrick Harvie that the 1343159_1347279
	Prime Minister’s comments last night were deeply irresponsible and I hope that, in time, 1347279_1352860
	she will reflect on that. 1352860_1354519
	The Prime Minister’s comments also failed to accept any of the responsibility that she 1354519_1359540
	bears for the mess that the United Kingdom is in right now. She wanted to blame everybody 1359540_1365789
	except herself, and yet I think that most people know that it was the Prime Minister 1365789_1370159
	who triggered article 50 without a plan. It was the Prime Minister who drew self-defeating, 1370159_1375230
	contradictory red lines that boxed her in from the start. It was the Prime Minister 1375230_1378570
	who called an unnecessary general election and who delayed the first vote on her deal 1378570_1383759
	in an attempt to run down the clock. It was the Prime Minister who failed to listen and 1383759_1387620
	change course after the first defeat of her deal and then again after the second. She 1387620_1392810
	must change course now before it is too late and she must bear responsibility for the mess 1392810_1398610
	that this country is in. 1398610_1400720
	On the issue of independence, the frustration that people feel right now at Scotland’s 1400720_1406350
	future being determined by the Democratic Unionist Party and a cabal of right-wing Tories 1406350_1411700
	is understandable, and I absolutely share it. I said that I would wait until the end 1411700_1417820
	of this phase of the Brexit negotiations before setting out my views on the way forward for 1417820_1422879
	Scotland. Having done so this long, I think that it is reasonable for me to wait to see 1422879_1428409
	what clarity emerges in the next few days, even if I suspect that it will just be clarity 1428409_1433730
	that there will be no clarity. I will then set out my views on the path forward. 1433730_1441540
	Nobody can be in any doubt that change is needed. The past three years have shown that 1441540_1447100
	the status quo is broken. It cannot protect Scotland from the folly of Brexit and all 1447100_1453299
	that flows from that. Even the most ardent unionist must see that the way we are now 1453299_1458650
	governed by Westminster is broken. The question is how we fix that for the future, and there 1458650_1465039
	is no doubt in my mind that letting people in Scotland choose an independent future is 1465039_1470019
	the best way to do that. 1470019_1474530
	Patrick Harvie: At every stage of this nightmare, this Parliament 1474530_1484259
	has tried to persuade the Prime Minister to change course. We have called for the narrow 1484259_1489600
	2016 result and Scotland’s remain vote to be respected, for our place in the single 1489600_1495879
	market to be protected and for the public to have the right of a final say and the chance 1495879_1501390
	to cancel this crisis. If the Prime Minister succeeds in closing off all those positive 1501390_1508649
	choices and the country finds itself being driven to the edge of the cliff at this time 1508649_1514850
	next week, does the First Minister agree that MPs must be prepared, finally, to put the 1514850_1522320
	public interest first and willing, if all else fails, to do what is necessary and revoke 1522320_1528379
	article 50? 1528379_1529379
	The First Minister: Yes. Indeed, the Scottish National Party at 1529379_1534620
	Westminster and the Greens, the Liberal Democrats and Plaid Cymru issued a joint statement last 1534620_1539700
	night to that effect. SNP MPs will not vote for the Prime Minister’s deal, because it 1539700_1545940
	is a bad deal that will damage Scottish interests. I do not think that any Scottish MP should 1545940_1551639
	vote for such a deal. However, nor will we accept the Prime Minister framing it as a 1551639_1556390
	choice between her deal and no deal. Just because she is not willing to contemplate 1556390_1562889
	the alternatives does not mean that there are no alternatives. One of those alternatives 1562889_1568429
	is, undoubtedly, revoking article 50. If all else fails by this time next week, that is 1568429_1575529
	exactly what MPs should do. 1575529_1580230
	Willie Rennie (North East Fife) (LD): I associate myself and my party with the First 1580230_1584941
	Minister’s remarks about New Zealand. The events in that country were truly sickening. 1584941_1589820
	You would not think that we were in the middle of a national crisis if you just listened 1589820_1594420
	to the questions from the leaders of the Conservative and Labour parties, but the last thing this 1594420_1601019
	country needs is more division and chaos with independence to compound the division and 1601019_1607020
	chaos of Brexit. [Interruption.] 1607020_1611549
	The Presiding Officer: Order, please. 1611549_1612549
	Willie Rennie: The first duty of a Prime Minister is to keep 1612549_1616009
	the country safe but, because of the cavalier choices of this Prime Minister, emergency 1616009_1622679
	measures under operation yellowhammer have been triggered and medicines, food supply 1622679_1628810
	chains and transport are all at risk. Does the First Minister agree that no serious Prime 1628810_1634460
	Minister should ever threaten such catastrophic consequences, no matter how much she wants 1634460_1641090
	her policy to be agreed? 1641090_1643580
	The First Minister (Nicola Sturgeon): Before I address Willie Rennie’s question, 1643580_1644933
	I say in response to the first part of what he said that the inconsistency in his position 1644933_1650720
	is this: he wants people across the United Kingdom to have the ability to escape Brexit 1650720_1656289
	through a second referendum—and I agree with him on that—but if that does not prove 1656289_1660940
	to be possible, he thinks that Scotland should just grin and bear it, and put up with the 1660940_1665029
	devastation of Brexit, instead of Scotland having the choice to escape Brexit and have 1665029_1671020
	an independent future. That is a deeply inconsistent position for him to take and I hope that he 1671020_1677159
	will reflect on it. 1677159_1680559
	On operation yellowhammer, which is the emergency planning for a no-deal Brexit, it is beyond 1680559_1690159
	comprehension that any Prime Minister could knowingly allow the country to be eight days—about 1690159_1697610
	200 hours—away from the possibility of crashing out of the European Union without a deal and 1697610_1704299
	to require that emergency planning work to be done. Yesterday, as I have done once a 1704299_1710019
	week for several weeks, I chaired a meeting of the Scottish Government’s resilience 1710019_1713370
	committee that was looking at medicine supplies, food supplies and transport links in the event 1713370_1719010
	of a no-deal Brexit. It is outrageous that we have to expend time, energy and resources 1719010_1725950
	on doing that. Before any more time passes and it is too late, the Prime Minister must 1725950_1733639
	change course, take no deal off the table completely, look to build a broader consensus 1733639_1740220
	rather than pandering to the hardliners in her own party and, if necessary, dump Brexit 1740220_1746470
	completely. That would be in the best interests of the country. 1746470_1749809
	Willie Rennie: The First Minister is wrong. The inconsistency 1749809_1754249
	is to believe that breaking up an economic partnership of 40 years will be chaotic but 1754249_1760759
	that breaking up one of 300 years will be a piece of cake. [Interruption.] 1760759_1764269
	The Presiding Officer: Order, please. 1764269_1765269
	Willie Rennie: The First Minister is the inconsistent one. 1765269_1766700
	[Interruption.] 1766700_1767700
	The Presiding Officer: Order, please. 1767700_1768700
	Willie Rennie: People are scunnered by this agonising Brexit 1768700_1772000
	process. We are three years on, with 200 hours left. Is it not time for a commonsense approach 1772000_1779740
	under which the Prime Minister takes a no-deal Brexit off the table instead of using it as 1779740_1788309
	a threat against her own citizens; all party leaders sit down and talk instead of the leader 1788309_1796070
	of the Opposition walking out because he does not like Chuka Umunna; the Prime Minister 1796070_1800990
	reaches out to MPs in Parliament rather than insulting them from behind a podium in number 1800990_1807020
	10; and we admit that Parliament is incapable of deciding, so we have a public vote to let 1807020_1815009
	the people decide? Is it not time for that commonsense approach? 1815009_1819299
	The First Minister: Yes, I agree with all that. I think that people 1819299_1825082
	across the UK should have the opportunity to vote again, given everything that they 1825082_1830090
	now know that was not known in 2016. That is why I will be calling for that public vote 1830090_1835620
	in London on Saturday, along with many others—no doubt, hundreds of thousands of others. 1835620_1843140
	I agree with everything that the member said about the Prime Minister, and I share his 1843140_1846669
	despair about the leader of the Labour Party and his childish behaviour last night at a 1846669_1851150
	time when we need people to come together to find an alternative. Where I disagree with 1851150_1856789
	the member is on his view that, if all of what he has just called for fails, Scotland 1856789_1862230
	is powerless in the face of the disaster of Brexit. I oppose Brexit, as he does, but there 1862230_1868250
	was nothing inevitable about the chaos of Brexit. That is down to those who proposed 1868250_1874190
	it having no idea what it would look like in reality and doing no planning for it. It 1874190_1878800
	did not have to be that way. 1878800_1882700
	I say to Willie Rennie that the inconsistency is in him standing up to rightly spell out 1882700_1887430
	what a disaster Brexit will be but then saying that, if all else fails, Scotland just has 1887430_1892990
	to put up with it. I do not think that Scotland has to put up with it and I do not think that 1892990_1896950
	Scotland should have to put up with it. If it comes to it, Scotland choosing independence 1896950_1901020
	is a much brighter future than remaining part of Brexit Britain. 1901020_1904271
	The Presiding Officer: We have some additional supplementaries. 1904271_1911470
	Jenny Gilruth (Mid Fife and Glenrothes) (SNP): Last night, the Prime Minister claimed that 1911470_1916360
	the public have had enough; today, a petition on the UK Parliament website calling for article 1916360_1921440
	50 to be revoked is already well on the way to 1 million signatures. Support is growing 1921440_1926889
	so fast that the website crashed harder than the Prime Minister’s credibility. If the 1926889_1932649
	Prime Minister believes that the people are with her, should she not have the courage 1932649_1936350
	to put that to the test and call for a people’s vote? 1936350_1939510
	The First Minister (Nicola Sturgeon): Yes, I agree. As I said, I thought that the 1939510_1944230
	Prime Minister’s statement last night was deeply regrettable. For her to blame everybody 1944230_1949749
	except herself beggars belief. Now is the time for people across parties to speak out. 1949749_1956509
	Last night, I watched one of the most powerful contributions that I have ever seen in the 1956509_1963529
	House of Commons. It was from Dominic Grieve, a moderate Tory who I think everybody would 1963529_1965190
	accept is an honourable person. He had the honesty to say that he was ashamed to be in 1965190_1971179
	the Conservative Party and that the conduct of the Prime Minister made him want to weep, 1971179_1975669
	yet Scottish Conservatives continue to parrot the lines of the Prime Minister. I often wonder 1975669_1981990
	whether Jackson Carlaw ever, in his quieter moments, thinks that it might be better for 1981990_1988080
	the country and indeed his own reputation for him to say what I believe he probably 1988080_1993920
	thinks—that this is a mess, that carrying on regardless is a profound mistake and that 1993920_1998850
	the Prime Minister must change course and must do so now before it is too late. 1998850_2004529
	Daniel Johnson (Edinburgh Southern) (Lab): The First Minister will be aware that the 2004529_2011389
	British Retail Consortium annual crime survey was published today. It records that, last 2011389_2016419
	year, 115 shop workers were physically attacked at work every single day across the United 2016419_2021309
	Kingdom. The Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers—USDAW—estimates that the 2021309_2024269
	real problem could be much greater; its estimate is that 34 retail workers are attacked every 2024269_2028860
	day in Scotland alone. 2028860_2030960
	My bill to protect shop workers is in the final stages of drafting. What does the First 2030960_2035490
	Minister think needs to be done to tackle this growing problem and will her Government 2035490_2040749
	work with me to look at what changes in the law may be needed to do so? Everyone has the 2040749_2045470
	right to be safe at work, whether they work in an office or on a shop floor. 2045470_2048869
	The First Minister (Nicola Sturgeon): I thank Daniel Johnson for raising the issue 2048869_2054250
	and the results of the British Retail Consortium’s survey. It is a powerful reminder that our 2054250_2060020
	shop workers do an essential job that is often dangerous to them, for which we all owe them 2060020_2066520
	a huge debt of gratitude. 2066520_2068340
	We will be happy to work with Daniel Johnson and others to look at what further protections 2068340_2072790
	we need to put in place. He said that his bill is in the final stages of drafting; we 2072790_2077710
	will look carefully at it when it is published and we will be happy to consider it and discuss 2077710_2083389
	it with him. We will be happy to try to build consensus. 2083389_2088429
	Mark McDonald (Aberdeen Donside) (Ind): On 1 April, employer contributions to national 2088429_2092550
	health service pension schemes will increase from 14.9 to 20.9 per cent. Children’s hospices 2092550_2099100
	across Scotland have estimated that the increased cost to them will be equivalent to the salaries 2099100_2103110
	of nine full-time nurses. The United Kingdom Government has stated that funding for charities 2103110_2107250
	and hospices is included in the funding that has been provided to NHS England to cover 2107250_2110980
	the costs of the increase, but the Children’s Hospice Association Scotland says that similar 2110980_2113200
	commitments have not yet been made to Scottish charities and hospices. Will the Scottish 2113200_2118530
	Government provide funding to help charities and hospice organisations to meet the cost 2118530_2121920
	increase and ensure that they do not have to divert money from the vital support services 2121920_2125810
	that they provide? 2125810_2126810
	The First Minister (Nicola Sturgeon): I thank Mark McDonald for rightly raising 2126810_2129540
	the issue, which is concerning generally and in particular for hospices and charities. 2129540_2137060
	The Scottish Government has been in discussions with the British Medical Association about 2137060_2141170
	how best to disburse additional funding to practices to meet the change. We will continue 2141170_2147340
	to discuss that, and I will ask the health secretary to look at the position of hospices 2147340_2151530
	and charities and to come back to Mark McDonald when she has done so. 2151530_2156520
	Christine Grahame (Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale) (SNP): 2156520_2159690
	To ask the First Minister, in light of the reported travel chaos on the Borders railway 2159690_2163990
	last weekend as a result of a number of train cancellations, whether the Scottish Government 2163990_2168930
	considers that the ScotRail franchise continues to be sustainable. (S5F-03189) 2168930_2172720
	The First Minister (Nicola Sturgeon): I am disappointed that passengers across a 2172720_2176050
	number of routes on the ScotRail network continue to be affected by train cancellations as a 2176050_2180810
	consequence of ScotRail’s training backlog. There is evidence of some improvement in ScotRail’s 2180810_2186630
	performance nationally, but that will do little to reassure passengers who attempted to travel 2186630_2191200
	on the Borders railway last Sunday and were faced with an unacceptable number of cancellations. 2191200_2195780
	That is why ScotRail’s focus must remain on delivering a robust remedial plan that 2195780_2200270
	puts passenger interests at the forefront of restoring performance levels. The remedial 2200270_2204080
	plan has been specifically designed to militate against train crew and train fleet challenges, 2204080_2209220
	and I fully expect ScotRail to ensure that the plan is delivered in order to reaffirm 2209220_2213110
	passenger confidence in the railway. 2213110_2215220
	Christine Grahame: There was, indeed, a service meltdown. It 2215220_2218690
	was a breakdown, too—on the Borders railway on Sunday. The cancellations continued since 2218690_2227730
	then and continue today. 2227730_2229440
	I heard the Cabinet Secretary for Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity talking this 2229440_2231180
	morning about remedial notices. The second notice that was served requires that a plan 2231180_2235690
	be delivered soon. The plan might be delivered, but it will not deliver trains—plans do 2235690_2241510
	not drive trains. Is not it time that the Scottish Government told Abellio ScotRail 2241510_2246820
	that it is in the last chance saloon? I certainly think so, and so do my constituents. 2246820_2252270
	The First Minister: ScotRail should treat the remedial plan very 2252270_2259600
	much as the last chance saloon. That is the nature of it. ScotRail has been left in no 2259600_2266590
	doubt that its recent performance levels, particularly in the Borders and Fife, have 2266590_2271051
	been completely unacceptable. I have said that in the chamber and I heard Michael Matheson 2271051_2275210
	say it a short while ago, when members including Annabelle Ewing raised legitimate and understandable 2275210_2281480
	concerns on their constituents’ behalf. 2281480_2284090
	We have used contractual mechanisms that are in the franchise agreement to require the 2284090_2288400
	remedial plan. ScotRail will publish its performance remedial plan on its website shortly. The 2288400_2294560
	commitments in that plan have been contracted as a remedial agreement. Of course, if ScotRail 2294560_2300840
	does not achieve improved performance, or if it fails to deliver on its contractual 2300840_2304940
	commitments, it runs the risk of its franchise being terminated early. 2304940_2308730
	Rachael Hamilton (Ettrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire) (Con): 2308730_2312530
	I recently received a letter from a concerned Borders railway commuter. His letter says: 2312530_2317500
	“It has come to the point where there is genuine surprise that the train is running 2317500_2321650
	on time as opposed to it being so frequently cancelled ... The negative effects of this 2321650_2327750
	are significant, there is a financial penalty imposed by the nursery as a result of collecting 2327750_2333130
	my daughter” 2333130_2334130
	late, and 2334130_2335130
	“There is significant stress and anxiety because of the lateness at work”. 2335130_2339220
	Will the First Minister apologise on behalf of her transport secretary to the hundreds 2339220_2343970
	of commuters who are experiencing transport hell, and will she personally oversee the 2343970_2349480
	remedial plan that has been submitted by ScotRail, and which will be published in the next few 2349480_2354370
	days? 2354370_2355370
	The First Minister: The transport secretary will oversee that, 2355370_2357920
	because it is part of his responsibilities. However, as First Minister, I, too, will obviously 2357920_2364000
	retain a very close interest in the matter. 2364000_2366520
	I have made it very clear—I do not think that I can make it clearer—that some of 2366520_2370290
	ScotRail’s recent performance levels have been completely unacceptable. That is particularly, 2370290_2375100
	although not exclusively, the case on the Borders railway. I could stand here and talk 2375100_2379320
	about some of the reasons for that, including train delivery and training requirements. 2379320_2383290
	There have also been problems with trains coming into and going out of Edinburgh in 2383290_2391420
	the past couple of days to do with Network Rail failings. However, I am not going to 2391420_2394640
	talk about those reasons, because it is ScotRail’s responsibility to ensure that it lives up 2394640_2399720
	to its performance standards. That is why the remedial plan is so important and why 2399720_2405210
	ScotRail has to understand the seriousness of the obligation on it to deliver on the 2405210_2410840
	commitments that it makes in the plan. 2410840_2412480
	Mark Ruskell (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Green): Commuters are suffering from poor rail services 2412480_2416250
	across Scotland, especially in Fife. Last year, the then Minister for Transport and 2416250_2420730
	the Islands, Humza Yousaf, said in the chamber: 2420730_2423361
	“there will be an upgrade in the rolling stock later in 2018 or early in 2019. Nevertheless, 2423361_2429640
	people in Fife should not have to wait for that to get an improvement in their service”.—[Official 2429640_2432960
	Report, 25 January 2018; c 2.] 2432960_2434320
	Why are Fife commuters now being told that it will be the end of 2019 at the very earliest 2434320_2439830
	before any improvements come through? Does not the First Minister believe that it is 2439830_2443360
	time that she personally stepped in to take charge of the ScotRail crisis? 2443360_2447260
	The First Minister: I have made my views clear, and I will do 2447260_2451410
	so again. Those who are charged with and remunerated for the responsibility of running our railways 2451410_2459000
	are the ones who have to get that right. They have a responsibility to do so and to begin 2459000_2467100
	immediately to deliver the improvements that passengers want. That is what the remedial 2467100_2471560
	plan will focus very much on. 2471560_2473760
	Of course, significant investment is being made in our railways, with rolling stock being 2473760_2479610
	renewed and a lot of other positive work being done from which I hope passengers will start 2479610_2483940
	to benefit very soon. However, ScotRail must address the reasons for the dip in its performance—at 2483940_2490940
	least, those that are within its responsibility—and we expect it to do so very quickly. 2490940_2498640
	Liz Smith (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con): To ask the First Minister, in light of the 2498640_2502130
	parliamentary reports by both MSPs and MPs, what the Scottish Government's response is 2502130_2507620
	to the growing concerns about the effects of social media on the mental health of young 2507620_2511880
	people across Scotland. (S5F-03169) 2511880_2513160
	The First Minister (Nicola Sturgeon): We welcome the report that was published last 2513160_2516370
	week by the Public Audit and Post-legislative Scrutiny Committee on the relationship between 2516370_2519910
	social media and mental health. It made recommendations on the need for further research in the area. 2519910_2525420
	Next month, we will publish initial research on the links between unhealthy social media 2525420_2530340
	use and lower mental wellbeing, in particular in girls and young women. We are also committed 2530340_2536090
	to developing and publishing Scotland-specific advice on how young people can use social 2536090_2540190
	media in a healthy way. That advice, which will be co-produced with young people for 2540190_2544230
	young people, will be informed by the research that we will publish next month. 2544230_2548730
	Liz Smith: I thank the First Minister for that helpful 2548730_2552150
	answer. I am sure that the whole Parliament will be united in deep concern about the shocking 2552150_2557880
	statistics that say that 60 per cent of 16 to 25-year-olds believe that social media 2557880_2564260
	place “overwhelming pressure” on their age group, and that mental health referrals 2564260_2569330
	have increased by 22 per cent since 2014. Those are just some of the facts that have, 2569330_2574500
	quite rightly, led MSPs and MPs to state categorically that we all have a duty of care to protect 2574500_2580470
	vulnerable users. In addition to her previous answer, can the First Minister give us some 2580470_2587570
	details about the timescale that she envisages for implementing the task force delivery plan? 2587570_2594560
	The First Minister: First, I appreciate very much the sentiments 2594560_2601230
	behind, and the detail of, Liz Smith’s question. The internet and social media should be, and 2601230_2605630
	in many respects are, forces for good that we should embrace and welcome, but they also 2605630_2612210
	put considerable pressure on young people—in particular, young girls. Many of us have young 2612210_2619940
	girls in our families—I have a niece who is about to enter her teenage years—and 2619940_2623020
	it is not difficult to see that pressure. We must ensure that our young people are equipped 2623020_2629740
	to deal with it properly. 2629740_2632000
	I have referred to research that we will publish and work that will flow from it. The task 2632000_2638320
	force is taking forward a substantial programme of work. I will ask the Minister for Mental 2638320_2643832
	Health to write to Liz Smith with the precise timescales for delivery of the various aspects 2643832_2648900
	of the work. All that work is important, so that we can prevent mental health issues and 2648900_2654400
	provide treatment as quickly as possible, when it is required. Undoubtedly, part of 2654400_2657610
	prevention is encouragement of, and support for, healthy use of social media. 2657610_2662580
	Willie Coffey (Kilmarnock and Irvine Valley) (SNP): 2662580_2664950
	The First Minister will be aware of the tragic death of a young 18-year-old girl in Kilmarnock 2664950_2670200
	last weekend, which was followed only hours later by the death of another youngster in 2670200_2675340
	Ayrshire. I understand that there are no suspicious circumstances. A growing number of young people 2675340_2681240
	across Ayrshire seem to be ending their lives through suicide, which is clearly heartbreaking 2681240_2687090
	for their families and friends. Will the First Minister offer some hope to youngsters and 2687090_2692510
	their families by saying that services are there to help, and that if more can be done 2692510_2697290
	to help to put an end to such awful tragedies, it will be done? 2697290_2702510
	The First Minister: I give that assurance. I will not comment 2702510_2706650
	on individual cases, beyond saying that my thoughts and condolences are with the families 2706650_2710840
	involved. East Ayrshire Council is already looking at the incidents with the national 2710840_2716360
	health service, and will want to ensure that it responds appropriately. 2716360_2720180
	Across the chamber, we are committed to ensuring that, as the challenges around mental health 2720180_2730350
	change and develop, our responses do so, too. I have said previously in the chamber that, 2730350_2735190
	as the system has developed over many years, too many people are referred to specialist 2735190_2740920
	services because there are not services in the community for prevention and early intervention. 2740920_2747370
	Many of the initiatives that we are implementing through the investment that we announced recently 2747370_2751882
	are trying to redress that balance, so that there is a focus on prevention and early intervention, 2751882_2757280
	and so that we ensure that we also have specialist services when young people need them. I hope 2757280_2762830
	and believe that that programme of work has wide support across the chamber. 2762830_2766970
	The Presiding Officer: That concludes First Minister’s question 2766970_2770510
	time. Before we move on to the members’ business debate, we will have a short suspension 2770510_2777960
	to allow members, ministers and people in the gallery to change seats. 2777960_2782550
