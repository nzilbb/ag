00:00:01.849 --> 00:00:06.430
Before we move to the first question to the
First Minister, I invite the First Minister

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:09.879
to make a few remarks following the tragic
events in Christchurch in New Zealand.

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:13.600
The First Minister (Nicola Sturgeon):
Thank you, Presiding Officer. I begin today

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:18.450
with heartfelt condolences to the people of
New Zealand after last week’s appalling

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:24.010
terrorist attack in Christchurch. I hope that
people in New Zealand can take some comfort

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:28.740
from the knowledge that people across the
world stand in solidarity with them.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.000
Events in New Zealand have been felt deeply
here in Scotland, as in other countries, and

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.649
perhaps especially in our Muslim community.
Last week, Police Scotland arranged reassurance

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:44.979
patrols and visits to mosques and other places
of worship. On Friday, I visited Glasgow central

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:48.159
mosque with the justice secretary.

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:53.089
The Prime Minister of New Zealand has said
that nations around the world are engaged

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:59.889
in a global fight against far-right, racist
and extremist ideology. Regrettably, she is

00:00:59.889 --> 00:01:06.850
absolutely right. All of us have a responsibility
to engage in that fight. We must tackle hatred

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.729
and prejudice through the words that we use,
the actions that we take and the climate that

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.619
we create. I know that all parties in this
chamber will play their part in doing that.

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.969
In the past week, we have also seen an attack
in Utrecht and the stabbing of a teenager

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:26.420
in Surrey. Our condolences are with all those
who have been affected by those incidents

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:27.579
as well.

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:33.060
Let us today express sympathy and solidarity
with the victims of racist and extremist violence

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:39.310
in Christchurch and around the world. Above
all, let us make clear our determination that

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:47.340
the proponents of hate will be defeated by
the values of kindness, compassion and love.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.560
[Applause.]

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:57.710
The Presiding Officer:
We turn to questions to the First Minister,

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:58.710
the first of which is from Jackson Carlaw.

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.719
Jackson Carlaw (Eastwood) (Con):
I associate all of us in the Scottish Conservatives

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:08.030
with the First Minister’s remarks and offer
our support for any measures that are required

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.620
to reassure those who attend mosques in Scotland.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.420
Many Scots will have friends and family who
live in or regularly visit New Zealand and

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.670
who will have been deeply affected. However,
for many in Scotland’s Muslim community,

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.250
events on the other side of the world must
never have felt closer to home. As we embrace

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.090
them with our good wishes and condolences,
we must—as the First Minister said—work

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:36.280
together to think afresh about what must be
done by us all to counter this defining 21st

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.750
century scourge.

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.360
Over the past 10 years, the Scottish National
Party Government has launched two major drug

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:49.110
strategies. Tragically, during those 10 years
drug deaths have doubled. We are now on course

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:54.590
to have the largest number of drug deaths
per head anywhere in Europe. Does the First

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.360
Minister believe that the strategies have
been a success or a failure?

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.680
The First Minister (Nicola Sturgeon):
These are challenging issues and I readily

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:10.230
concede that this Government—any Government—must
remain open to fresh thinking and new ideas.

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:16.090
The situation with regard to drug deaths is
not one that any of us would consider to be

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:23.840
acceptable. However, as I said in the chamber
last week, many of those who have died have

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.200
lived with alcohol and drug use for a long
time—such people become more vulnerable

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:35.920
as they grow older as a result of their complex
health and social needs. Although I do not

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.080
overstate the point, more encouraging is the
fact that the last report showed fewer deaths

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:46.630
among the under-25 population. Recent reports
also highlight falling heroin use—again,

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:47.680
particularly among under-25s.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:54.090
As I am sure that Jackson Carlaw is aware,
work is under way in Dundee and Glasgow to

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:59.690
consider what more can be done to tackle drug
deaths. That work will be of relevance around

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.300
Scotland, but we want to see the outcomes
from it before we consider what further action

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.210
we should take.

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:10.920
Jackson Carlaw:
We all want to sort the crisis, but the first

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.330
step is surely to admit that the current policy
is not working as it should. Regrettably,

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.190
it has been a failure. I have an example of
that.

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.810
We know that rehabilitation services in prisons
can be vital in turning around people’s

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.280
lives. However, my colleague Adam Tomkins
has discovered in recent days that in Barlinnie,

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:32.090
which is one of our biggest prisons, a successful
voluntary project—a recovery cafe where

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:38.200
people can go to get their lives back on track—is
facing closure. How can it be right that we

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:44.730
prioritise spending millions of pounds on
methadone programmes, yet successful projects

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.080
such as the cafe are put at risk?

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:53.400
The First Minister:
First, I say to Jackson Carlaw and to Adam

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:58.490
Tomkins that the justice secretary has received
a letter on the issue, which will be responded

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:59.570
to in due course.

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:04.600
It is important that I advise members that
the Scottish Government has not previously

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:11.560
funded recovery cafes. However, we provide
funding for the Scottish Recovery Consortium,

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:16.830
and the Scottish Prison Service adopts a therapeutic
approach in dealing with addiction issues

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.790
and provides support for those with addiction
problems who are in their care.

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:25.240
The new alcohol and drug strategy highlights
the importance of recovery communities and

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:30.850
the need for them to be at the heart of any
proposals. They help to reduce stigma, because

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:36.190
they provide the visible face of recovery,
as well as insights into addiction and harm.

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:41.010
Through our sustained funding of the Scottish
Recovery Consortium, we will continue to do

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:44.900
what we can to support the growth of recovery
communities across the country.

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:50.910
We will of course give consideration to the
points that Adam Tomkins made in his letter.

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:53.400
Jackson Carlaw:
My question was not intended as a criticism

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:54.400
of that mix of approaches.

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.670
Just a few miles from Parliament is Castle
Craig hospital near West Linton, which is

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:02.590
a drug rehabilitation centre with capacity
for residential drug rehab patients, and which

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:05.320
the Conservative health spokesman, Miles Briggs,
visited recently. Hospital staff told him

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:09.970
that Castle Craig is not receiving national
health service referrals and is mostly kept

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:15.441
going by patients who are referred from the
Netherlands for treatment. Is not the First

00:06:15.441 --> 00:06:21.080
Minister, like me, concerned that Dutch patients
are getting better access to that rehabilitation

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:25.930
project here in Scotland than local Scots
who are in need of the same support and treatment?

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:31.840
The First Minister:
I am very happy to look into that specific

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:41.050
example. We want people to have access to
a broad range of rehabilitation services.

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:46.410
The Scottish Government is providing £70
million this financial year to reduce the

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:52.750
harms that are caused by alcohol and drugs.
That includes an additional £20 million for

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:57.150
drug and alcohol services, which is being
allocated to support new approaches, so that

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:07.000
we respond in a much more joined-up and person-centred
way. Such investment is important.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.160
I am not trying to make a party-political
point about a very serious issue, but it is

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:16.460
also important that we are prepared to take
forward innovative and evidence-based new

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:22.790
approaches, even if at first they seem to
be challenging, particularly for public opinion.

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:27.980
That is why we supported the principles behind
Glasgow’s proposals for a medically supervised

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:33.230
safer drug consumption facility and heroin-assisted
treatment in the city. It is important that

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:38.360
we work with health and social care partnerships
on new approaches, as well as ensuring that

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:43.620
we invest in rehabilitation. I hope that the
Conservatives will think about giving us support

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:48.230
on that, because we need to persuade the United
Kingdom Government to do what is required.

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:51.680
Jackson Carlaw:
I respect the First Minister’s approach

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:54.669
to that policy. We have looked at it, but,
unfortunately, it is the one policy in this

00:07:54.669 --> 00:07:58.810
area on which we fundamentally disagree. We
think that the policy should be to get people

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:02.870
clean of drugs, not to provide opportunities
for people to take them.

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:07.870
Scottish Conservatives have set out a clear
plan to tackle Scotland’s growing drugs

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:12.699
crisis, which is to get first-time offenders
into treatment, direct more money into rehabilitation

00:08:12.699 --> 00:08:18.900
programmes run by third sector bodies and,
at the same time, at least review the failed

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:19.900
methadone programme.

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:26.240
Let us admit that, in politics at the moment,
we are not overrun with issues on which we

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:31.630
can form consensus. However, on this one vital
issue, will the First Minister commit today

00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:35.990
to working across the chamber—we will commit
to that—to improve the drugs strategy for

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:42.159
the next 10 years, so that we can cut drug
deaths and drug addiction and come down hard

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:44.529
on those peddling misery in our communities?

00:08:44.529 --> 00:08:50.810
The First Minister:
I reiterate my willingness to work across

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:55.600
the chamber. I think that I have said in a
couple of my responses today that I will consider

00:08:55.600 --> 00:09:00.589
the points that Jackson Carlaw has raised,
and I give that reassurance again. I ask for

00:09:00.589 --> 00:09:06.480
the same in return. I am slightly concerned
at the almost knee-jerk way in which Jackson

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:12.459
Carlaw ruled out the fresh thinking around
safer drug consumption facilities. If we are

00:09:12.459 --> 00:09:17.040
genuinely to try and find a consensus, we
have to be open to new thinking, and that

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:23.189
will sometimes be very tough and challenging.
I appeal to Jackson Carlaw to reconsider his

00:09:23.189 --> 00:09:27.170
opposition to that policy, just as he is asking
me to be open-minded to any proposals that

00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:28.290
he makes.

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:33.110
We will continue to ensure that we have the
right strategies in place to deal with what

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:38.360
we all accept is a challenging and complex
issue. First, that involves taking a very

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:42.660
hard line against those who supply drugs—and
we saw figures earlier this week about police

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:48.720
seizures of drugs. Secondly, it definitely
involves support, particularly rehabilitation

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:54.249
support, for those who are addicted to drugs.
Thirdly, it involves being open to new ideas

00:09:54.249 --> 00:09:59.879
and new thinking. If we can all agree broadly
around that approach, perhaps we can build

00:09:59.879 --> 00:10:06.139
a consensus that allows us to tackle something
that we all agree is unacceptable. We want

00:10:06.139 --> 00:10:10.940
to see a considerably improved situation,
and I hope that we have the support of Jackson

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:14.839
Carlaw and the Conservatives on that.

00:10:14.839 --> 00:10:20.309
Richard Leonard (Central Scotland) (Lab):
I add the deep-felt condolences of the Scottish

00:10:20.309 --> 00:10:25.040
Labour Party to the families and friends of
all those who lost their lives in the terror

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:33.259
attack in Christchurch last Friday. I offer
our support for practical action to defeat

00:10:33.259 --> 00:10:38.009
racism and hatred wherever it occurs.

00:10:38.009 --> 00:10:43.009
To ask the First Minister why there is a staffing
crisis in the national health service.

00:10:43.009 --> 00:10:47.779
The First Minister (Nicola Sturgeon):
There is not a staffing crisis in the national

00:10:47.779 --> 00:10:52.869
health service. There are record numbers of
people working in the national health service.

00:10:52.869 --> 00:11:00.100
In fact, I can tell Richard Leonard that staffing
levels in NHS Scotland are now at a record

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:09.709
high and are up by more than 13,600 since
2006, just before this Government took office.

00:11:09.709 --> 00:11:15.839
The number of consultants is up by 51 per
cent; the number of qualified nurses and midwives

00:11:15.839 --> 00:11:20.540
is up by 8 per cent; and there is a higher
level of NHS staffing per head in Scotland

00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:22.769
than there is in NHS England.

00:11:22.769 --> 00:11:27.929
Our NHS staff of course work under considerable
pressure, and we are grateful to them for

00:11:27.929 --> 00:11:32.629
the job that they do, but we will continue
to invest in our NHS to ensure that there

00:11:32.629 --> 00:11:37.269
are record numbers of staff, so that they
can continue to deliver the excellent services

00:11:37.269 --> 00:11:38.269
that they do.

00:11:38.269 --> 00:11:43.790
Richard Leonard:
This week, the Parliament’s Health and Sport

00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:49.019
Committee, following the tragic events at
the Queen Elizabeth university hospital, began

00:11:49.019 --> 00:11:55.800
its inquiry into infection control standards.
New figures released to Scottish Labour this

00:11:55.800 --> 00:12:01.220
week reveal that the number of domestic staff—that
is, cleaners—who are employed at the Queen

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:10.480
Elizabeth university hospital is falling.
In March 2018, 464 cleaners were employed

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:19.980
at the hospital. According to the latest figures,
that number has dropped to 440. Why, at the

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:27.889
very point when it is facing a rise in infection
outbreaks, is Scotland’s biggest hospital

00:12:27.889 --> 00:12:34.379
employing fewer people on the front line whose
job it is to keep that hospital clean and

00:12:34.379 --> 00:12:35.489
safe?

00:12:35.489 --> 00:12:40.649
The First Minister:
I am sure that Richard Leonard will have heard

00:12:40.649 --> 00:12:44.730
the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport
already address this issue publicly. The issue

00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:49.699
has been raised with Greater Glasgow and Clyde
NHS Board. It is absolutely imperative that

00:12:49.699 --> 00:12:54.620
all health boards in all hospitals ensure
appropriate numbers of domestic and cleaning

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:55.620
staff.

00:12:55.620 --> 00:13:00.670
It is of course for health boards to consider
the configuration of staffing. As Richard

00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:05.279
Leonard will know, and as those of us who
represent Glasgow constituencies know particularly

00:13:05.279 --> 00:13:09.470
well, there has been a significant change
in the configuration of Glasgow hospitals

00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:14.889
over the past number of years, and the overall
staffing numbers will undoubtedly reflect

00:13:14.889 --> 00:13:17.869
that.

00:13:17.869 --> 00:13:22.899
We will continue to raise issues directly
with health boards to ensure that they are

00:13:22.899 --> 00:13:28.130
addressed where that is necessary. Notwithstanding
the very serious incidents at the Queen Elizabeth

00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:31.759
university hospital, which we have discussed
on many occasions in the chamber before—and

00:13:31.759 --> 00:13:36.040
I welcome the Health and Sport Committee’s
inquiry into these issues—infection rates

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:41.319
are down considerably in Scottish hospitals
overall.

00:13:41.319 --> 00:13:47.420
I see that Jackie Baillie is in the chamber.
She and I regularly used to have exchanges

00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:50.949
about the levels of Clostridium difficile
in our hospitals, following the tragic incident

00:13:50.949 --> 00:13:55.579
at the Vale of Leven hospital. C diff, MRSA
and infections generally are down, in some

00:13:55.579 --> 00:13:58.079
cases by more than 80 per cent.

00:13:58.079 --> 00:14:03.629
Let us tackle issues where they arise—Richard
Leonard is right to raise them—but let us

00:14:03.629 --> 00:14:08.470
not lose sight of the good work that has been
done in our NHS to reduce infection and to

00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:10.949
put a real focus on patient safety.

00:14:10.949 --> 00:14:15.679
Richard Leonard:
I should also make it clear that the problem

00:14:15.679 --> 00:14:21.499
is not unique to one hospital: it is replicated
right across the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde

00:14:21.499 --> 00:14:28.569
area. There are fewer domestics, porters and
laundry and linen staff compared with last

00:14:28.569 --> 00:14:33.989
year’s levels. It is clear that we have
a staffing crisis in our health service, and

00:14:33.989 --> 00:14:39.649
that it is not confined to consultants, nurses
and midwives but extends to facilities staff,

00:14:39.649 --> 00:14:47.749
domestics, catering workers, porters and laundry
staff—all workers without whom no hospital

00:14:47.749 --> 00:14:50.329
can operate.

00:14:50.329 --> 00:14:54.649
We know that there is a parliamentary inquiry
and that reviews are being carried out by

00:14:54.649 --> 00:15:02.889
the health board and the Government. However,
these issues are serious and urgent. The public,

00:15:02.889 --> 00:15:08.519
and the staff who are under pressure, need
to hear a commitment that the reduction in

00:15:08.519 --> 00:15:13.949
such vital front-line jobs will be reversed
as soon as possible. Is the First Minister

00:15:13.949 --> 00:15:17.029
prepared to give them that commitment today?

00:15:17.029 --> 00:15:21.799
The First Minister:
As I said earlier, we will continue to work

00:15:21.799 --> 00:15:24.680
with health boards, including NHS Greater
Glasgow and Clyde, to ensure that they have

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:31.779
appropriate staffing levels across all specialties
in the NHS. That is important. I repeat what

00:15:31.779 --> 00:15:36.389
I have already said: record numbers of staff
are working in our national health service.

00:15:36.389 --> 00:15:41.509
Richard Leonard says that the issues are urgent,
and I could not agree more. I know how devastating

00:15:41.509 --> 00:15:45.879
outbreaks of infection in hospitals are—principally
for patients and their families, but also

00:15:45.879 --> 00:15:51.449
for the staff who work there. That is why
the Healthcare Environment Inspectorate’s

00:15:51.449 --> 00:15:53.889
report on the Queen Elizabeth university hospital,
which was commissioned and instructed by the

00:15:53.889 --> 00:15:59.269
Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport, has
already been completed, and why its recommendations

00:15:59.269 --> 00:16:04.800
have already been accepted by the health board
and are being implemented.

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:09.429
Whatever disagreements we might have, and
whatever legitimate points Richard Leonard

00:16:09.429 --> 00:16:13.920
might raise—they are legitimate points—I
do not think that anybody could doubt the

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:19.799
seriousness of the Government and the health
service when it comes to tackling infections

00:16:19.799 --> 00:16:26.100
in our hospitals. Overall, the figures state
that things are going in the right direction,

00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:30.579
but that does not take away from the need
to tackle serious incidents when they arise.

00:16:30.579 --> 00:16:32.670
We will continue to do exactly that.

00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:36.589
The Presiding Officer:
We turn to constituency supplementary questions,

00:16:36.589 --> 00:16:38.920
the first of which is from Liam Kerr.

00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:43.259
Liam Kerr (North East Scotland) (Con):
Cove harbour fishing community is suffering.

00:16:43.259 --> 00:16:48.179
First, its landing was bought—and closed—by
a private landlord. It went to court and won

00:16:48.179 --> 00:16:52.259
rights of public access but faced significant
legal costs. Several boats were then destroyed

00:16:52.259 --> 00:16:56.069
in a fire, and now the landlord has closed
access to the beach. Community representatives

00:16:56.069 --> 00:16:58.829
have written to the Cabinet Secretary for
the Rural Economy, Fergus Ewing, several times,

00:16:58.829 --> 00:17:02.759
requesting a meeting—even if that were to
be here at Holyrood—to discuss their rights

00:17:02.759 --> 00:17:04.530
and their future, but to no avail.

00:17:04.530 --> 00:17:08.649
Will the First Minister ask the cabinet secretary
to meet those representatives, and not risk

00:17:08.649 --> 00:17:10.799
ignoring a community that faces the loss of
its livelihood?

00:17:10.799 --> 00:17:14.579
The First Minister (Nicola Sturgeon):
Of course, the Scottish Government wants to

00:17:14.579 --> 00:17:20.399
do everything possible to help any community
that is experiencing difficulties. Beyond

00:17:20.399 --> 00:17:23.110
what the member has just said, I am not aware
of the content of the correspondence with

00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:27.829
Fergus Ewing, but I am happy to give an undertaking
to look into that and, if the cabinet secretary

00:17:27.829 --> 00:17:31.730
thinks that the Scottish Government can offer
help, for him to meet those who are affected.

00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:37.530
Dr Alasdair Allan (Na h-Eileanan an Iar) (SNP):
Earlier this week, the Office of Gas and Electricity

00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:42.649
Markets announced that it was minded to reject
proposals for a 600MW transmission link to

00:17:42.649 --> 00:17:48.970
the Western Isles, saying that it would instead
support a much-reduced 450MW link. That has

00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:52.990
been met with extreme disappointment in my
constituency, because it will severely constrain

00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:56.920
capacity for future community projects and
place other existing projects from the Western

00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:59.590
Isles at a potential disadvantage.

00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:03.940
What pressure can the Scottish Government
put on Ofgem, and the United Kingdom Government,

00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:04.940
to reconsider that short-sighted decision?

00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:09.549
The First Minister (Nicola Sturgeon):
The Scottish Government is absolutely committed

00:18:09.549 --> 00:18:14.669
to unlocking the vast renewables potential
of our islands and the associated economic

00:18:14.669 --> 00:18:19.190
benefits for our island communities. We are
very concerned at the uncertainty over the

00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:23.620
proposed connection from the Western Isles.
The Government believes that for the islands’

00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:28.669
full renewables potential to be realised,
a larger link is required, so I very much

00:18:28.669 --> 00:18:33.101
agree with the sentiment of Alasdair Allan’s
question. We have made arguments directly

00:18:33.101 --> 00:18:38.010
to Ofgem to support that point, and we will
continue to do so as we engage further with

00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:43.929
it and with island stakeholders and developers
during the on-going consultation process.

00:18:43.929 --> 00:18:49.100
I assure Alasdair Allan—and the chamber—that
we will make absolutely every effort to secure

00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:51.500
the right outcome for the Western Isles.

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:57.450
Jackie Baillie (Dumbarton) (Lab):
The First Minister will be aware that my constituent

00:18:57.450 --> 00:19:03.299
Jagtar Singh Johal has spent more than 500
days detained in prison in the Punjab. There

00:19:03.299 --> 00:19:09.690
have been accusations of torture and he has
now faced his 77th pre-trial preliminary hearing.

00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:15.350
His MP, Martin Docherty-Hughes, is to be commended
for pursuing the matter vigorously.

00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:19.919
Will the First Minister use her influence
and speak to the Foreign Secretary and the

00:19:19.919 --> 00:19:24.519
United Kingdom Government to urge them to
provide support and assistance to Mr Johal

00:19:24.519 --> 00:19:25.519
and his family?

00:19:25.519 --> 00:19:28.929
The First Minister (Nicola Sturgeon):
I thank Jackie Baillie for raising this issue.

00:19:28.929 --> 00:19:34.750
I know that she has raised it previously and
she is right to say that Martin Docherty-Hughes

00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:39.929
MP has been assiduous in raising the rights
and situation of his constituent.

00:19:39.929 --> 00:19:43.880
We have raised this issue and we will continue
to do so. The Deputy First Minister has raised

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:50.730
it directly with Indian ministers on recent
visits to India and with the British high

00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:55.390
commission. I believe—although I will double-check
this—that we have raised the issue directly

00:19:55.390 --> 00:20:02.450
with the Foreign Office. If not, I am happy
to undertake that we will do so.

00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:05.880
Miles Briggs (Lothian) (Con):
In recent weeks, I have received correspondence

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:10.191
from families across Scotland who are facing
unacceptable waits for cleft surgery. Two

00:20:10.191 --> 00:20:13.880
years ago, we warned Scottish National Party
ministers about the impact of the closure

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:18.929
of the Edinburgh unit and the centralisation
of cleft services. This Parliament voted against

00:20:18.929 --> 00:20:22.870
centralisation, but ministers pressed on against
the will of Parliament.

00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:26.820
One case highlighted to me just this week
is that of a young man who has been waiting

00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:32.170
two years for a promised final surgery and
is no further forward on when he will receive

00:20:32.170 --> 00:20:36.440
that. Families are also telling me that they
are looking to NHS England in order to receive

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:41.070
the surgery. Will the First Minister apologise
to families for those waits? What will she

00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:43.880
do to correct the mistake that this Government
made?

00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:46.960
The First Minister (Nicola Sturgeon):
As I have said many times before in the chamber,

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:52.740
I regret it when any patient has to wait longer
for treatment than we would want to be the

00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:53.740
case.

00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:58.980
On the issue of cleft surgery, as I recall,
the redesign of that service was on clinical

00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:05.470
grounds, to ensure a quality and safe service.
If Miles Briggs would like to give further

00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:08.610
details of the constituents who are raising
issues with him, the Cabinet Secretary for

00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:13.659
Health and Sport will look into those and,
once she has had the opportunity to do that,

00:21:13.659 --> 00:21:16.200
will correspond further with him.

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:21.200
Patrick Harvie (Glasgow) (Green):
On behalf of the Scottish Greens, I join others

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:28.169
in expressing our shared concern for the bereaved
and injured following the far-right terrorist

00:21:28.169 --> 00:21:35.000
attack in New Zealand, but also our respect
for the response that that country is showing,

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:42.039
recommitting to the values of its inclusive
society and refusing to placate the far right,

00:21:42.039 --> 00:21:47.600
as far too many politicians around the world
have done.

00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:52.779
Last night, in the midst of a crisis of her
own making, the Prime Minister again refused

00:21:52.779 --> 00:22:00.480
to listen to reason and instead effectively
told the public that Parliament is their enemy.

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:06.750
Scotland needs the freedom to take a different
direction, leave behind this chaos and find

00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:13.029
our own way out of the crisis. That is why
we need our independence. The First Minister

00:22:13.029 --> 00:22:18.279
told us that she would say something about
her preferred timing within weeks. That was

00:22:18.279 --> 00:22:23.159
two months ago. I ask again, when?

00:22:23.159 --> 00:22:27.279
The First Minister (Nicola Sturgeon):
First, I agree with Patrick Harvie that the

00:22:27.279 --> 00:22:32.860
Prime Minister’s comments last night were
deeply irresponsible and I hope that, in time,

00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:34.519
she will reflect on that.

00:22:34.519 --> 00:22:39.540
The Prime Minister’s comments also failed
to accept any of the responsibility that she

00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:45.789
bears for the mess that the United Kingdom
is in right now. She wanted to blame everybody

00:22:45.789 --> 00:22:50.159
except herself, and yet I think that most
people know that it was the Prime Minister

00:22:50.159 --> 00:22:55.230
who triggered article 50 without a plan. It
was the Prime Minister who drew self-defeating,

00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:58.570
contradictory red lines that boxed her in
from the start. It was the Prime Minister

00:22:58.570 --> 00:23:03.759
who called an unnecessary general election
and who delayed the first vote on her deal

00:23:03.759 --> 00:23:07.620
in an attempt to run down the clock. It was
the Prime Minister who failed to listen and

00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:12.810
change course after the first defeat of her
deal and then again after the second. She

00:23:12.810 --> 00:23:18.610
must change course now before it is too late
and she must bear responsibility for the mess

00:23:18.610 --> 00:23:20.720
that this country is in.

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:26.350
On the issue of independence, the frustration
that people feel right now at Scotland’s

00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:31.700
future being determined by the Democratic
Unionist Party and a cabal of right-wing Tories

00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:37.820
is understandable, and I absolutely share
it. I said that I would wait until the end

00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:42.879
of this phase of the Brexit negotiations before
setting out my views on the way forward for

00:23:42.879 --> 00:23:48.409
Scotland. Having done so this long, I think
that it is reasonable for me to wait to see

00:23:48.409 --> 00:23:53.730
what clarity emerges in the next few days,
even if I suspect that it will just be clarity

00:23:53.730 --> 00:24:01.540
that there will be no clarity. I will then
set out my views on the path forward.

00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:07.100
Nobody can be in any doubt that change is
needed. The past three years have shown that

00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:13.299
the status quo is broken. It cannot protect
Scotland from the folly of Brexit and all

00:24:13.299 --> 00:24:18.650
that flows from that. Even the most ardent
unionist must see that the way we are now

00:24:18.650 --> 00:24:25.039
governed by Westminster is broken. The question
is how we fix that for the future, and there

00:24:25.039 --> 00:24:30.019
is no doubt in my mind that letting people
in Scotland choose an independent future is

00:24:30.019 --> 00:24:34.530
the best way to do that.

00:24:34.530 --> 00:24:44.259
Patrick Harvie:
At every stage of this nightmare, this Parliament

00:24:44.259 --> 00:24:49.600
has tried to persuade the Prime Minister to
change course. We have called for the narrow

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:55.879
2016 result and Scotland’s remain vote to
be respected, for our place in the single

00:24:55.879 --> 00:25:01.390
market to be protected and for the public
to have the right of a final say and the chance

00:25:01.390 --> 00:25:08.649
to cancel this crisis. If the Prime Minister
succeeds in closing off all those positive

00:25:08.649 --> 00:25:14.850
choices and the country finds itself being
driven to the edge of the cliff at this time

00:25:14.850 --> 00:25:22.320
next week, does the First Minister agree that
MPs must be prepared, finally, to put the

00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:28.379
public interest first and willing, if all
else fails, to do what is necessary and revoke

00:25:28.379 --> 00:25:29.379
article 50?

00:25:29.379 --> 00:25:34.620
The First Minister:
Yes. Indeed, the Scottish National Party at

00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:39.700
Westminster and the Greens, the Liberal Democrats
and Plaid Cymru issued a joint statement last

00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:45.940
night to that effect. SNP MPs will not vote
for the Prime Minister’s deal, because it

00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:51.639
is a bad deal that will damage Scottish interests.
I do not think that any Scottish MP should

00:25:51.639 --> 00:25:56.390
vote for such a deal. However, nor will we
accept the Prime Minister framing it as a

00:25:56.390 --> 00:26:02.889
choice between her deal and no deal. Just
because she is not willing to contemplate

00:26:02.889 --> 00:26:08.429
the alternatives does not mean that there
are no alternatives. One of those alternatives

00:26:08.429 --> 00:26:15.529
is, undoubtedly, revoking article 50. If all
else fails by this time next week, that is

00:26:15.529 --> 00:26:20.230
exactly what MPs should do.

00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:24.941
Willie Rennie (North East Fife) (LD):
I associate myself and my party with the First

00:26:24.941 --> 00:26:29.820
Minister’s remarks about New Zealand. The
events in that country were truly sickening.

00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:34.420
You would not think that we were in the middle
of a national crisis if you just listened

00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:41.019
to the questions from the leaders of the Conservative
and Labour parties, but the last thing this

00:26:41.019 --> 00:26:47.020
country needs is more division and chaos with
independence to compound the division and

00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:51.549
chaos of Brexit. [Interruption.]

00:26:51.549 --> 00:26:52.549
The Presiding Officer:
Order, please.

00:26:52.549 --> 00:26:56.009
Willie Rennie:
The first duty of a Prime Minister is to keep

00:26:56.009 --> 00:27:02.679
the country safe but, because of the cavalier
choices of this Prime Minister, emergency

00:27:02.679 --> 00:27:08.810
measures under operation yellowhammer have
been triggered and medicines, food supply

00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:14.460
chains and transport are all at risk. Does
the First Minister agree that no serious Prime

00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:21.090
Minister should ever threaten such catastrophic
consequences, no matter how much she wants

00:27:21.090 --> 00:27:23.580
her policy to be agreed?

00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:24.933
The First Minister (Nicola Sturgeon):
Before I address Willie Rennie’s question,

00:27:24.933 --> 00:27:30.720
I say in response to the first part of what
he said that the inconsistency in his position

00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:36.289
is this: he wants people across the United
Kingdom to have the ability to escape Brexit

00:27:36.289 --> 00:27:40.940
through a second referendum—and I agree
with him on that—but if that does not prove

00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:45.029
to be possible, he thinks that Scotland should
just grin and bear it, and put up with the

00:27:45.029 --> 00:27:51.020
devastation of Brexit, instead of Scotland
having the choice to escape Brexit and have

00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:57.159
an independent future. That is a deeply inconsistent
position for him to take and I hope that he

00:27:57.159 --> 00:28:00.559
will reflect on it.

00:28:00.559 --> 00:28:10.159
On operation yellowhammer, which is the emergency
planning for a no-deal Brexit, it is beyond

00:28:10.159 --> 00:28:17.610
comprehension that any Prime Minister could
knowingly allow the country to be eight days—about

00:28:17.610 --> 00:28:24.299
200 hours—away from the possibility of crashing
out of the European Union without a deal and

00:28:24.299 --> 00:28:30.019
to require that emergency planning work to
be done. Yesterday, as I have done once a

00:28:30.019 --> 00:28:33.370
week for several weeks, I chaired a meeting
of the Scottish Government’s resilience

00:28:33.370 --> 00:28:39.010
committee that was looking at medicine supplies,
food supplies and transport links in the event

00:28:39.010 --> 00:28:45.950
of a no-deal Brexit. It is outrageous that
we have to expend time, energy and resources

00:28:45.950 --> 00:28:53.639
on doing that. Before any more time passes
and it is too late, the Prime Minister must

00:28:53.639 --> 00:29:00.220
change course, take no deal off the table
completely, look to build a broader consensus

00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:06.470
rather than pandering to the hardliners in
her own party and, if necessary, dump Brexit

00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:09.809
completely. That would be in the best interests
of the country.

00:29:09.809 --> 00:29:14.249
Willie Rennie:
The First Minister is wrong. The inconsistency

00:29:14.249 --> 00:29:20.759
is to believe that breaking up an economic
partnership of 40 years will be chaotic but

00:29:20.759 --> 00:29:24.269
that breaking up one of 300 years will be
a piece of cake. [Interruption.]

00:29:24.269 --> 00:29:25.269
The Presiding Officer:
Order, please.

00:29:25.269 --> 00:29:26.700
Willie Rennie:
The First Minister is the inconsistent one.

00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:27.700
[Interruption.]

00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:28.700
The Presiding Officer:
Order, please.

00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:32.000
Willie Rennie:
People are scunnered by this agonising Brexit

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:39.740
process. We are three years on, with 200 hours
left. Is it not time for a commonsense approach

00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:48.309
under which the Prime Minister takes a no-deal
Brexit off the table instead of using it as

00:29:48.309 --> 00:29:56.070
a threat against her own citizens; all party
leaders sit down and talk instead of the leader

00:29:56.070 --> 00:30:00.990
of the Opposition walking out because he does
not like Chuka Umunna; the Prime Minister

00:30:00.990 --> 00:30:07.020
reaches out to MPs in Parliament rather than
insulting them from behind a podium in number

00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:15.009
10; and we admit that Parliament is incapable
of deciding, so we have a public vote to let

00:30:15.009 --> 00:30:19.299
the people decide? Is it not time for that
commonsense approach?

00:30:19.299 --> 00:30:25.082
The First Minister:
Yes, I agree with all that. I think that people

00:30:25.082 --> 00:30:30.090
across the UK should have the opportunity
to vote again, given everything that they

00:30:30.090 --> 00:30:35.620
now know that was not known in 2016. That
is why I will be calling for that public vote

00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:43.140
in London on Saturday, along with many others—no
doubt, hundreds of thousands of others.

00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:46.669
I agree with everything that the member said
about the Prime Minister, and I share his

00:30:46.669 --> 00:30:51.150
despair about the leader of the Labour Party
and his childish behaviour last night at a

00:30:51.150 --> 00:30:56.789
time when we need people to come together
to find an alternative. Where I disagree with

00:30:56.789 --> 00:31:02.230
the member is on his view that, if all of
what he has just called for fails, Scotland

00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:08.250
is powerless in the face of the disaster of
Brexit. I oppose Brexit, as he does, but there

00:31:08.250 --> 00:31:14.190
was nothing inevitable about the chaos of
Brexit. That is down to those who proposed

00:31:14.190 --> 00:31:18.800
it having no idea what it would look like
in reality and doing no planning for it. It

00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:22.700
did not have to be that way.

00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:27.430
I say to Willie Rennie that the inconsistency
is in him standing up to rightly spell out

00:31:27.430 --> 00:31:32.990
what a disaster Brexit will be but then saying
that, if all else fails, Scotland just has

00:31:32.990 --> 00:31:36.950
to put up with it. I do not think that Scotland
has to put up with it and I do not think that

00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:41.020
Scotland should have to put up with it. If
it comes to it, Scotland choosing independence

00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:44.271
is a much brighter future than remaining part
of Brexit Britain.

00:31:44.271 --> 00:31:51.470
The Presiding Officer:
We have some additional supplementaries.

00:31:51.470 --> 00:31:56.360
Jenny Gilruth (Mid Fife and Glenrothes) (SNP):
Last night, the Prime Minister claimed that

00:31:56.360 --> 00:32:01.440
the public have had enough; today, a petition
on the UK Parliament website calling for article

00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:06.889
50 to be revoked is already well on the way
to 1 million signatures. Support is growing

00:32:06.889 --> 00:32:12.649
so fast that the website crashed harder than
the Prime Minister’s credibility. If the

00:32:12.649 --> 00:32:16.350
Prime Minister believes that the people are
with her, should she not have the courage

00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:19.510
to put that to the test and call for a people’s
vote?

00:32:19.510 --> 00:32:24.230
The First Minister (Nicola Sturgeon):
Yes, I agree. As I said, I thought that the

00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:29.749
Prime Minister’s statement last night was
deeply regrettable. For her to blame everybody

00:32:29.749 --> 00:32:36.509
except herself beggars belief. Now is the
time for people across parties to speak out.

00:32:36.509 --> 00:32:43.529
Last night, I watched one of the most powerful
contributions that I have ever seen in the

00:32:43.529 --> 00:32:45.190
House of Commons. It was from Dominic Grieve,
a moderate Tory who I think everybody would

00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:51.179
accept is an honourable person. He had the
honesty to say that he was ashamed to be in

00:32:51.179 --> 00:32:55.669
the Conservative Party and that the conduct
of the Prime Minister made him want to weep,

00:32:55.669 --> 00:33:01.990
yet Scottish Conservatives continue to parrot
the lines of the Prime Minister. I often wonder

00:33:01.990 --> 00:33:08.080
whether Jackson Carlaw ever, in his quieter
moments, thinks that it might be better for

00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:13.920
the country and indeed his own reputation
for him to say what I believe he probably

00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:18.850
thinks—that this is a mess, that carrying
on regardless is a profound mistake and that

00:33:18.850 --> 00:33:24.529
the Prime Minister must change course and
must do so now before it is too late.

00:33:24.529 --> 00:33:31.389
Daniel Johnson (Edinburgh Southern) (Lab):
The First Minister will be aware that the

00:33:31.389 --> 00:33:36.419
British Retail Consortium annual crime survey
was published today. It records that, last

00:33:36.419 --> 00:33:41.309
year, 115 shop workers were physically attacked
at work every single day across the United

00:33:41.309 --> 00:33:44.269
Kingdom. The Union of Shop, Distributive and
Allied Workers—USDAW—estimates that the

00:33:44.269 --> 00:33:48.860
real problem could be much greater; its estimate
is that 34 retail workers are attacked every

00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:50.960
day in Scotland alone.

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:55.490
My bill to protect shop workers is in the
final stages of drafting. What does the First

00:33:55.490 --> 00:34:00.749
Minister think needs to be done to tackle
this growing problem and will her Government

00:34:00.749 --> 00:34:05.470
work with me to look at what changes in the
law may be needed to do so? Everyone has the

00:34:05.470 --> 00:34:08.869
right to be safe at work, whether they work
in an office or on a shop floor.

00:34:08.869 --> 00:34:14.250
The First Minister (Nicola Sturgeon):
I thank Daniel Johnson for raising the issue

00:34:14.250 --> 00:34:20.020
and the results of the British Retail Consortium’s
survey. It is a powerful reminder that our

00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:26.520
shop workers do an essential job that is often
dangerous to them, for which we all owe them

00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:28.340
a huge debt of gratitude.

00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:32.790
We will be happy to work with Daniel Johnson
and others to look at what further protections

00:34:32.790 --> 00:34:37.710
we need to put in place. He said that his
bill is in the final stages of drafting; we

00:34:37.710 --> 00:34:43.390
will look carefully at it when it is published
and we will be happy to consider it and discuss

00:34:43.390 --> 00:34:48.429
it with him. We will be happy to try to build
consensus.

00:34:48.429 --> 00:34:52.550
Mark McDonald (Aberdeen Donside) (Ind):
On 1 April, employer contributions to national

00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:59.100
health service pension schemes will increase
from 14.9 to 20.9 per cent. Children’s hospices

00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:03.110
across Scotland have estimated that the increased
cost to them will be equivalent to the salaries

00:35:03.110 --> 00:35:07.250
of nine full-time nurses. The United Kingdom
Government has stated that funding for charities

00:35:07.250 --> 00:35:10.980
and hospices is included in the funding that
has been provided to NHS England to cover

00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:13.200
the costs of the increase, but the Children’s
Hospice Association Scotland says that similar

00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:18.530
commitments have not yet been made to Scottish
charities and hospices. Will the Scottish

00:35:18.530 --> 00:35:21.920
Government provide funding to help charities
and hospice organisations to meet the cost

00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:25.810
increase and ensure that they do not have
to divert money from the vital support services

00:35:25.810 --> 00:35:26.810
that they provide?

00:35:26.810 --> 00:35:29.540
The First Minister (Nicola Sturgeon):
I thank Mark McDonald for rightly raising

00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:37.060
the issue, which is concerning generally and
in particular for hospices and charities.

00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:41.170
The Scottish Government has been in discussions
with the British Medical Association about

00:35:41.170 --> 00:35:47.340
how best to disburse additional funding to
practices to meet the change. We will continue

00:35:47.340 --> 00:35:51.530
to discuss that, and I will ask the health
secretary to look at the position of hospices

00:35:51.530 --> 00:35:56.520
and charities and to come back to Mark McDonald
when she has done so.

00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:59.690
Christine Grahame (Midlothian South, Tweeddale
and Lauderdale) (SNP):

00:35:59.690 --> 00:36:03.990
To ask the First Minister, in light of the
reported travel chaos on the Borders railway

00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:08.930
last weekend as a result of a number of train
cancellations, whether the Scottish Government

00:36:08.930 --> 00:36:12.720
considers that the ScotRail franchise continues
to be sustainable. (S5F-03189)

00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:16.050
The First Minister (Nicola Sturgeon):
I am disappointed that passengers across a

00:36:16.050 --> 00:36:20.810
number of routes on the ScotRail network continue
to be affected by train cancellations as a

00:36:20.810 --> 00:36:26.630
consequence of ScotRail’s training backlog.
There is evidence of some improvement in ScotRail’s

00:36:26.630 --> 00:36:31.200
performance nationally, but that will do little
to reassure passengers who attempted to travel

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:35.780
on the Borders railway last Sunday and were
faced with an unacceptable number of cancellations.

00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:40.270
That is why ScotRail’s focus must remain
on delivering a robust remedial plan that

00:36:40.270 --> 00:36:44.080
puts passenger interests at the forefront
of restoring performance levels. The remedial

00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:49.220
plan has been specifically designed to militate
against train crew and train fleet challenges,

00:36:49.220 --> 00:36:53.110
and I fully expect ScotRail to ensure that
the plan is delivered in order to reaffirm

00:36:53.110 --> 00:36:55.220
passenger confidence in the railway.

00:36:55.220 --> 00:36:58.690
Christine Grahame:
There was, indeed, a service meltdown. It

00:36:58.690 --> 00:37:07.730
was a breakdown, too—on the Borders railway
on Sunday. The cancellations continued since

00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:09.440
then and continue today.

00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:11.180
I heard the Cabinet Secretary for Transport,
Infrastructure and Connectivity talking this

00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:15.690
morning about remedial notices. The second
notice that was served requires that a plan

00:37:15.690 --> 00:37:21.510
be delivered soon. The plan might be delivered,
but it will not deliver trains—plans do

00:37:21.510 --> 00:37:26.820
not drive trains. Is not it time that the
Scottish Government told Abellio ScotRail

00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:32.270
that it is in the last chance saloon? I certainly
think so, and so do my constituents.

00:37:32.270 --> 00:37:39.600
The First Minister:
ScotRail should treat the remedial plan very

00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:46.590
much as the last chance saloon. That is the
nature of it. ScotRail has been left in no

00:37:46.590 --> 00:37:51.051
doubt that its recent performance levels,
particularly in the Borders and Fife, have

00:37:51.051 --> 00:37:55.210
been completely unacceptable. I have said
that in the chamber and I heard Michael Matheson

00:37:55.210 --> 00:38:01.480
say it a short while ago, when members including
Annabelle Ewing raised legitimate and understandable

00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:04.090
concerns on their constituents’ behalf.

00:38:04.090 --> 00:38:08.400
We have used contractual mechanisms that are
in the franchise agreement to require the

00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:14.560
remedial plan. ScotRail will publish its performance
remedial plan on its website shortly. The

00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:20.840
commitments in that plan have been contracted
as a remedial agreement. Of course, if ScotRail

00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:24.940
does not achieve improved performance, or
if it fails to deliver on its contractual

00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:28.730
commitments, it runs the risk of its franchise
being terminated early.

00:38:28.730 --> 00:38:32.530
Rachael Hamilton (Ettrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire)
(Con):

00:38:32.530 --> 00:38:37.500
I recently received a letter from a concerned
Borders railway commuter. His letter says:

00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:41.650
“It has come to the point where there is
genuine surprise that the train is running

00:38:41.650 --> 00:38:47.750
on time as opposed to it being so frequently
cancelled ... The negative effects of this

00:38:47.750 --> 00:38:53.130
are significant, there is a financial penalty
imposed by the nursery as a result of collecting

00:38:53.130 --> 00:38:54.130
my daughter”

00:38:54.130 --> 00:38:55.130
late, and

00:38:55.130 --> 00:38:59.220
“There is significant stress and anxiety
because of the lateness at work”.

00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:03.970
Will the First Minister apologise on behalf
of her transport secretary to the hundreds

00:39:03.970 --> 00:39:09.480
of commuters who are experiencing transport
hell, and will she personally oversee the

00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:14.370
remedial plan that has been submitted by ScotRail,
and which will be published in the next few

00:39:14.370 --> 00:39:15.370
days?

00:39:15.370 --> 00:39:17.920
The First Minister:
The transport secretary will oversee that,

00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:24.000
because it is part of his responsibilities.
However, as First Minister, I, too, will obviously

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.520
retain a very close interest in the matter.

00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:30.290
I have made it very clear—I do not think
that I can make it clearer—that some of

00:39:30.290 --> 00:39:35.100
ScotRail’s recent performance levels have
been completely unacceptable. That is particularly,

00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:39.320
although not exclusively, the case on the
Borders railway. I could stand here and talk

00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:43.290
about some of the reasons for that, including
train delivery and training requirements.

00:39:43.290 --> 00:39:51.420
There have also been problems with trains
coming into and going out of Edinburgh in

00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:54.640
the past couple of days to do with Network
Rail failings. However, I am not going to

00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:59.720
talk about those reasons, because it is ScotRail’s
responsibility to ensure that it lives up

00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:05.210
to its performance standards. That is why
the remedial plan is so important and why

00:40:05.210 --> 00:40:10.840
ScotRail has to understand the seriousness
of the obligation on it to deliver on the

00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:12.480
commitments that it makes in the plan.

00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:16.250
Mark Ruskell (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Green):
Commuters are suffering from poor rail services

00:40:16.250 --> 00:40:20.730
across Scotland, especially in Fife. Last
year, the then Minister for Transport and

00:40:20.730 --> 00:40:23.361
the Islands, Humza Yousaf, said in the chamber:

00:40:23.361 --> 00:40:29.640
“there will be an upgrade in the rolling
stock later in 2018 or early in 2019. Nevertheless,

00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:32.960
people in Fife should not have to wait for
that to get an improvement in their service”.—[Official

00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:34.320
Report, 25 January 2018; c 2.]

00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:39.830
Why are Fife commuters now being told that
it will be the end of 2019 at the very earliest

00:40:39.830 --> 00:40:43.360
before any improvements come through? Does
not the First Minister believe that it is

00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:47.260
time that she personally stepped in to take
charge of the ScotRail crisis?

00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:51.410
The First Minister:
I have made my views clear, and I will do

00:40:51.410 --> 00:40:59.000
so again. Those who are charged with and remunerated
for the responsibility of running our railways

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:07.100
are the ones who have to get that right. They
have a responsibility to do so and to begin

00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:11.560
immediately to deliver the improvements that
passengers want. That is what the remedial

00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:13.760
plan will focus very much on.

00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:19.610
Of course, significant investment is being
made in our railways, with rolling stock being

00:41:19.610 --> 00:41:23.940
renewed and a lot of other positive work being
done from which I hope passengers will start

00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:30.940
to benefit very soon. However, ScotRail must
address the reasons for the dip in its performance—at

00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:38.640
least, those that are within its responsibility—and
we expect it to do so very quickly.

00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:42.130
Liz Smith (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con):
To ask the First Minister, in light of the

00:41:42.130 --> 00:41:47.620
parliamentary reports by both MSPs and MPs,
what the Scottish Government's response is

00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:51.880
to the growing concerns about the effects
of social media on the mental health of young

00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:53.160
people across Scotland. (S5F-03169)

00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:56.370
The First Minister (Nicola Sturgeon):
We welcome the report that was published last

00:41:56.370 --> 00:41:59.910
week by the Public Audit and Post-legislative
Scrutiny Committee on the relationship between

00:41:59.910 --> 00:42:05.420
social media and mental health. It made recommendations
on the need for further research in the area.

00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:10.340
Next month, we will publish initial research
on the links between unhealthy social media

00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:16.090
use and lower mental wellbeing, in particular
in girls and young women. We are also committed

00:42:16.090 --> 00:42:20.190
to developing and publishing Scotland-specific
advice on how young people can use social

00:42:20.190 --> 00:42:24.230
media in a healthy way. That advice, which
will be co-produced with young people for

00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:28.730
young people, will be informed by the research
that we will publish next month.

00:42:28.730 --> 00:42:32.150
Liz Smith:
I thank the First Minister for that helpful

00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:37.880
answer. I am sure that the whole Parliament
will be united in deep concern about the shocking

00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:44.260
statistics that say that 60 per cent of 16
to 25-year-olds believe that social media

00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:49.330
place “overwhelming pressure” on their
age group, and that mental health referrals

00:42:49.330 --> 00:42:54.500
have increased by 22 per cent since 2014.
Those are just some of the facts that have,

00:42:54.500 --> 00:43:00.470
quite rightly, led MSPs and MPs to state categorically
that we all have a duty of care to protect

00:43:00.470 --> 00:43:07.570
vulnerable users. In addition to her previous
answer, can the First Minister give us some

00:43:07.570 --> 00:43:14.560
details about the timescale that she envisages
for implementing the task force delivery plan?

00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:21.230
The First Minister:
First, I appreciate very much the sentiments

00:43:21.230 --> 00:43:25.630
behind, and the detail of, Liz Smith’s question.
The internet and social media should be, and

00:43:25.630 --> 00:43:32.210
in many respects are, forces for good that
we should embrace and welcome, but they also

00:43:32.210 --> 00:43:39.940
put considerable pressure on young people—in
particular, young girls. Many of us have young

00:43:39.940 --> 00:43:43.020
girls in our families—I have a niece who
is about to enter her teenage years—and

00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:49.740
it is not difficult to see that pressure.
We must ensure that our young people are equipped

00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:52.000
to deal with it properly.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:58.320
I have referred to research that we will publish
and work that will flow from it. The task

00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:03.832
force is taking forward a substantial programme
of work. I will ask the Minister for Mental

00:44:03.832 --> 00:44:08.900
Health to write to Liz Smith with the precise
timescales for delivery of the various aspects

00:44:08.900 --> 00:44:14.400
of the work. All that work is important, so
that we can prevent mental health issues and

00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:17.610
provide treatment as quickly as possible,
when it is required. Undoubtedly, part of

00:44:17.610 --> 00:44:22.580
prevention is encouragement of, and support
for, healthy use of social media.

00:44:22.580 --> 00:44:24.950
Willie Coffey (Kilmarnock and Irvine Valley)
(SNP):

00:44:24.950 --> 00:44:30.200
The First Minister will be aware of the tragic
death of a young 18-year-old girl in Kilmarnock

00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:35.340
last weekend, which was followed only hours
later by the death of another youngster in

00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:41.240
Ayrshire. I understand that there are no suspicious
circumstances. A growing number of young people

00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:47.090
across Ayrshire seem to be ending their lives
through suicide, which is clearly heartbreaking

00:44:47.090 --> 00:44:52.510
for their families and friends. Will the First
Minister offer some hope to youngsters and

00:44:52.510 --> 00:44:57.290
their families by saying that services are
there to help, and that if more can be done

00:44:57.290 --> 00:45:02.510
to help to put an end to such awful tragedies,
it will be done?

00:45:02.510 --> 00:45:06.650
The First Minister:
I give that assurance. I will not comment

00:45:06.650 --> 00:45:10.840
on individual cases, beyond saying that my
thoughts and condolences are with the families

00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:16.360
involved. East Ayrshire Council is already
looking at the incidents with the national

00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:20.180
health service, and will want to ensure that
it responds appropriately.

00:45:20.180 --> 00:45:30.350
Across the chamber, we are committed to ensuring
that, as the challenges around mental health

00:45:30.350 --> 00:45:35.190
change and develop, our responses do so, too.
I have said previously in the chamber that,

00:45:35.190 --> 00:45:40.920
as the system has developed over many years,
too many people are referred to specialist

00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:47.370
services because there are not services in
the community for prevention and early intervention.

00:45:47.370 --> 00:45:51.882
Many of the initiatives that we are implementing
through the investment that we announced recently

00:45:51.882 --> 00:45:57.280
are trying to redress that balance, so that
there is a focus on prevention and early intervention,

00:45:57.280 --> 00:46:02.830
and so that we ensure that we also have specialist
services when young people need them. I hope

00:46:02.830 --> 00:46:06.970
and believe that that programme of work has
wide support across the chamber.

00:46:06.970 --> 00:46:10.510
The Presiding Officer:
That concludes First Minister’s question

00:46:10.510 --> 00:46:17.960
time. Before we move on to the members’
business debate, we will have a short suspension

00:46:17.960 --> 00:46:22.550
to allow members, ministers and people in
the gallery to change seats.
