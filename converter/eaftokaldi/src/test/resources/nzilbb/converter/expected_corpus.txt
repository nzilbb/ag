rest of that side of the famly so he
generously agreed that she could go with him but
there were so many people there
that nothing was done constructively
right
wa they just didn't get on to the interviews or
it was just everybody talked and had a chat yeah
there were no interviews they all talked everybody talked yeah and just
caught up to date yeah
whereas he wanted to go along
just on a one to one basis
and say now nin
tell us about grandfather you know
gran er f grandfather pepper and
how he built up his business and na na
and tell us what you can remember of the house
you used to live in because
barry and i knew the house
that they lived in you know yeah
and he was a very actually
a very well to do builder in wanganui at that time
and ah ah
ah thelma pepper was the eldest daughter of about
oh i don't know six
children
or seven six or seven children and um
she um was
fairly um
what's the word ah
well she they were a very correct family mmm
and and although they weren't
very religious necessarily
i'd i think they were
they were anglican maybe
and maybe they didn't really have a
an official religion or something but
of course if
a arthur pepper and fred were
out of england
mmm they'd come from england
to establish
and so on and
lived in new zealand and
ah fred ah pepper was a
um plumber guy
ah but had he was a ah
a much a very much of an entrepreneur
also and did th
things with barges on the wanganui river
and all that sort of thing
and of course if
arthur who was our
barry and i's grandfather
he was always a builder
and had a very successful building company
and had all his sons in it mmm
and which is why grandpop was a builder
and ah grandpop
did his trade
not with pepper but with
ah the wanganui sash and door company
and he was more of a mmm
what did they used to call them
not a fitter and turner
but he was more of a cabinet maker
oh yeah
and then he worked because he
he was impressed with mother
hm he hung around for years
right through the depression
and the parent
the pepper parents
were wealthy
and here was a young fellow
ah who rode a motorbike hm
which wasn't exactly the thing to be done no
and um they w
he was chasing their eldest daughter ah wi
with whom they were very proud you see
and she sang and she sang on the radio
and did all sorts of interesting things
in those days
and um he ah
but he kept hanging around and
the father took
the girls because of course there were
three or four girls in the family
mother thelma was the eldest
he took them all to fiji or somewhere
for a long holiday trying to shake off
this guy august fromont yeah
and um
because august was a devout catholic
and had been bought by
a very strict french grandmother
who was a devout catholic
and he became a very devout
catholic himself of course but um
ah they weren't all that keen about
the catholicism thing mmm
ah and he had nothing
he he had a motorbike
he didn't have anything else
he owned some property
in the petone foreshore
w ah as he
saved up some money he bought property
but during the depression
they were out of work
and he couldn't keep the payments up
so he lost the property mmm
and they grew potatoes on it
so he used to tell us
just as a cash crop you know
mmm but of course he lost the property
and whatever he'd built up for himself as
financial background backing
cos he had nothing at all
ah and his own father
died when he was five
grandpops father had been killed on the railway
yeah yeah when he was five
that's why he was brought up by his
and his grandmother
brought
brought him up
and the whole family was split up
and and ah when
when the disaster happened again
because he'd had disaster after disaster
in his family life
when his own wife was killed
when he was fifty
the day he was fifty
then um
he refused to let any
of the family be broken up
that was us
grandmother
yeah
we were the eldest ones
of course i was seventeen
barry was nineteen
how did she die
and ah he she
and ah cyril would arrive at the door
with this letter for mum
and and then there was a message
and i think they both had telephones
ah at that time
we certainly had a telephone at our place
and i think molly always had a telephone so
then i suppose
there was a phone call to say
oh yeah yeah and we'll see you there
or whatever mmm you know
but then molly walked in
and immediately i grabbed molly
because i knew se she was so close
and i told her all about it
yeah and ah
ah and i said come quick come quick
dad's at home
and he's a hell of a mess
yeah sort of words you know yeah
which he was he was beside himself
well inconsolable i imagine
he was you know so
i don't know how we got back there
whether we got a taxi or
the priests ran us up
you know because
the township's quite a long from where we lived in
and ah shit
and i remember
she came home and tried to console dad and
he said oh she's just cooked me a cake
for my fiftieth birthday
which was on the bench mmm
and um
at a certain stage
i had to go
the same night i think
after i'd seen molly
i think she went
to my to our place
to k try to find
pop and console him
and i had to go back with the police
to to um
to identify mum right
and um
and that was very difficult
yeah
but later i got back home
and i remember
molly had gone and dad was
there but s you know very
depressed as shit and so on
and barry was just coming back from
camp he was at ohakia as a
he was in the air force
at that time
he did air force training as an eighteen year old and
he he was there
and he arrived back
with one of his friends
and i remember going out to the front
ah of the house
beside the garage
and of course you know he'd just come in
to wanganui and
didn't know a bloody thing
and i said to him
barry barry come in
dad wants to talk to you
and so his friend said oh well
oh see you later you know and
rode away on his bike or whatever he had
a motorbike or something
or a car
and of course you know
it was just barry and i
there were no other children at that time mmm
so he came in and
learned all the disaster
goodness
and have you got all that
well the funny light hasn't gone on
again
did you switch it off or what
well i turned it over
i thought it might be something to do with
where it was on the tape
i must go and have a leak you know
if you'll excuse me
okay
see if i can figure out what that light was
well i think you should
listen to it because o
very often when you're recording
if you don't listen to them pretty quickly
you bloody find out
that the microphone is malfunctioning
or some and there's nothing much on it or
now where is it in the back left
yeah yeah yeah well that's right
ah yeah just turn left there
that mum and dad had looked at a house
in the country
on the main road which
was driving towards taranaki
and it was a country house
with a long drive in
you know over the field and
into the house and
and i'd said to barry once or twice gosh
if they'd bought that house
when they first looked at it
she'd still be alive today
because well this is years ago
of course i made these comments
because that would have removed
her from the danger that was present on that
main road somme parade hm
well it wasn't a main road it was
a feeder road
ah and we'd have all lived in the country and
ah well not that it wa~
you know it wasn't that far out
it was up by virginia lake
i don't know whether you know wanganui much but
i don't really know it at all
so after all that you said that
you said that
grandpop didn't let you
like he kept the family together how
oh well he of course people
al~ always come forward
and offer to take
some of the children
yeah how many of how many were there
well there was five of us five
