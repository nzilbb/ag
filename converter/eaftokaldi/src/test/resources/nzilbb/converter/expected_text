t1__82.252-84.158 very religious necessarily
t1__84.158-86.049 i'd i think they were
t1__86.049-87.517 they were anglican maybe
t1__87.517-89.235 and maybe they didn't really have a
t1__89.235-92.141 an official religion or something but
t1__92.141-93.485 of course if
t1__93.485-95.922 a arthur pepper and fred were
t1__95.922-97.671 out of england
t1__97.671-99.171 mmm they'd come from england

t1__120.479-121.885 and all that sort of thing
t1__121.885-123.634 and of course if
t1__123.634-125.806 arthur who was our

t1__137.398-140.366 and had all his sons in it mmm
t1__140.366-142.053 and which is why grandpop was a builder
t1__142.053-144.147 and ah grandpop
t1__144.147-145.584 did his trade
t1__145.584-148.459 not with pepper but with
t1__148.459-151.489 ah the wanganui sash and door company
t1__151.489-154.614 and he was more of a mmm
t1__154.614-155.708 what did they used to call them
t1__155.708-156.770 not a fitter and turner
t1__156.770-158.926 but he was more of a cabinet maker
t1__158.926-159.457 oh yeah
t1__159.457-161.551 and then he worked because he
t1__161.551-164.363 he was impressed with mother
t1__164.363-167.206 hm he hung around for years
t1__167.206-168.643 right through the depression
t1__168.643-169.736 and the parent
t1__169.736-171.454 the pepper parents
t1__171.454-172.391 were wealthy
t1__172.391-174.640 and here was a young fellow
t1__174.640-176.171 ah who rode a motorbike hm
t1__176.171-179.452 which wasn't exactly the thing to be done no
t1__179.452-181.108 and um they w
t1__181.108-184.045 he was chasing their eldest daughter ah wi
t1__184.045-186.670 with whom they were very proud you see

t1__193.029-196.341 and um he ah
t1__196.341-198.841 but he kept hanging around and
t1__198.841-199.841 the father took
t1__199.841-202.716 the girls because of course there were
t1__202.716-205.403 three or four girls in the family
t1__205.403-208.809 mother thelma was the eldest
t1__208.809-211.340 he took them all to fiji or somewhere
t1__211.340-214.152 for a long holiday trying to shake off
t1__214.152-217.058 this guy august fromont yeah
t1__217.058-220.214 and um
t1__220.214-222.745 because august was a devout catholic
t1__222.745-224.807 and had been bought by
t1__224.807-227.119 a very strict french grandmother
t1__227.119-229.274 who was a devout catholic
t1__229.274-231.649 and he became a very devout
t1__231.649-235.023 catholic himself of course but um
t1__235.023-236.741 ah they weren't all that keen about
t1__236.741-238.709 the catholicism thing mmm
t1__238.709-240.646 ah and he had nothing
t1__240.646-241.802 he he had a motorbike
t1__241.802-243.426 he didn't have anything else
t1__243.426-244.707 he owned some property
t1__244.707-246.769 in the petone foreshore
t1__246.769-248.175 w ah as he
t1__248.175-250.862 saved up some money he bought property
t1__250.862-252.830 but during the depression
t1__252.830-253.986 they were out of work
t1__253.986-255.611 and he couldn't keep the payments up
t1__255.611-257.751 so he lost the property mmm
t1__257.751-260.282 and they grew potatoes on it
t1__260.282-261.407 so he used to tell us
t1__261.407-263.469 just as a cash crop you know
t1__263.469-265.531 mmm but of course he lost the property
t1__265.531-270.468 and whatever he'd built up for himself as
t1__270.468-272.218 financial background backing
t1__272.218-274.186 cos he had nothing at all
t1__274.186-276.529 ah and his own father
t1__276.529-279.341 died when he was five
t1__279.341-281.715 grandpops father had been killed on the railway
t1__281.715-282.871 yeah yeah when he was five
t1__282.871-283.965 that's why he was brought up by his
t1__283.965-284.797 and his grandmother
t1__284.797-285.340 brought
t1__285.340-286.215 brought him up
t1__286.215-289.214 and the whole family was split up
t1__289.214-291.183 and and ah when
t1__291.183-293.885 when the disaster happened again
t1__293.885-296.416 because he'd had disaster after disaster
t1__296.416-297.444 in his family life
t1__297.444-299.666 when his own wife was killed
t1__299.666-301.478 when he was fifty
t1__301.478-303.572 the day he was fifty
t1__303.572-305.446 then um
t1__305.446-307.914 he refused to let any
t1__307.914-309.633 of the family be broken up
t1__309.633-310.602 that was us
t1__284.840-285.340 grandmother
t1__310.602-311.071 yeah
t1__311.071-312.696 we were the eldest ones
t1__312.696-314.165 of course i was seventeen
t1__314.165-316.258 barry was nineteen
t1__316.258-317.195 how did she die
t1__317.195-320.757 and ah he she
t2__0.000-5.750 and ah cyril would arrive at the door
t2__5.750-6.907 with this letter for mum
t2__6.907-9.126 and and then there was a message
t2__9.126-12.126 and i think they both had telephones
t2__12.126-13.220 ah at that time
t2__13.220-16.033 we certainly had a telephone at our place
t2__16.033-18.315 and i think molly always had a telephone so
t2__18.315-19.236 then i suppose
t2__19.236-20.423 there was a phone call to say
t2__20.423-21.985 oh yeah yeah and we'll see you there
t2__21.985-23.563 or whatever mmm you know
t2__23.563-25.501 but then molly walked in
t2__25.501-27.533 and immediately i grabbed molly
t2__27.533-30.440 because i knew se she was so close
t2__30.440-32.003 and i told her all about it
t2__32.003-34.535 yeah and ah
t2__34.535-37.567 ah and i said come quick come quick
t2__37.567-38.786 dad's at home
t2__38.786-40.473 and he's a hell of a mess
t2__40.473-42.223 yeah sort of words you know yeah
t2__42.223-44.255 which he was he was beside himself
t2__44.255-45.505 well inconsolable i imagine
t2__45.505-50.006 he was you know so
t2__50.006-51.631 i don't know how we got back there
t2__51.631-53.225 whether we got a taxi or
t2__53.225-54.319 the priests ran us up
t2__54.319-55.444 you know because
t2__55.444-60.101 the township's quite a long from where we lived in
t2__60.101-64.851 and ah shit
t2__64.851-66.664 and i remember
t2__66.664-70.195 she came home and tried to console dad and

t2__72.633-74.039 for my fiftieth birthday
t2__74.039-76.476 which was on the bench mmm
t2__76.476-79.726 and um
t2__79.726-81.101 at a certain stage
t2__81.101-82.538 i had to go
t2__82.538-83.975 the same night i think
t2__83.975-85.163 after i'd seen molly
t2__85.163-86.726 i think she went
t2__86.726-88.070 to my to our place
t2__88.070-89.508 to k try to find
t2__89.508-92.367 pop and console him

t2__98.742-101.398 to identify mum right
t2__101.398-105.929 and um
t2__105.929-107.804 and that was very difficult
t2__107.804-110.335 yeah
t2__110.335-112.397 but later i got back home
t2__112.397-114.021 and i remember

t2__136.673-138.642 he he was there
t2__138.642-140.111 and he arrived back
t2__140.111-141.579 with one of his friends
t2__141.579-145.610 and i remember going out to the front
t2__145.610-146.891 ah of the house
t2__146.891-147.797 beside the garage
t2__147.797-149.828 and of course you know he'd just come in

t2__151.734-152.796 didn't know a bloody thing
t2__152.796-153.796 and i said to him
t2__153.796-155.140 barry barry come in
t2__155.140-158.264 dad wants to talk to you

t2__181.652-183.995 goodness
t2__183.995-185.339 and have you got all that
t2__185.339-188.932 well the funny light hasn't gone on
t2__188.932-189.464 again
t2__189.464-191.682 did you switch it off or what
t2__191.682-193.650 well i turned it over
t2__193.650-195.025 i thought it might be something to do with
t2__195.025-197.181 where it was on the tape
t2__197.181-198.275 i must go and have a leak you know
t2__198.275-199.213 if you'll excuse me
t2__199.213-201.775 okay
t2__201.775-205.415 see if i can figure out what that light was
t2__205.415-206.415 well i think you should
t2__206.415-207.790 listen to it because o
t2__207.790-209.977 very often when you're recording
t2__209.977-211.837 if you don't listen to them pretty quickly
t2__211.837-212.806 you bloody find out
t2__212.806-214.822 that the microphone is malfunctioning
t2__214.822-218.290 or some and there's nothing much on it or
t2__218.290-220.696 now where is it in the back left
t2__214.822-218.290 yeah yeah yeah well that's right
t2__220.696-223.227 ah yeah just turn left there
t2__229.852-233.727 that mum and dad had looked at a house
t2__233.727-236.946 in the country
t2__236.946-239.039 on the main road which
t2__239.039-242.788 was driving towards taranaki
t2__242.788-245.069 and it was a country house
t2__245.069-246.413 with a long drive in
t2__246.413-248.834 you know over the field and
t2__248.834-250.522 into the house and
t2__250.522-253.147 and i'd said to barry once or twice gosh
t2__253.147-256.928 if they'd bought that house
t2__256.928-259.053 when they first looked at it
t2__259.053-260.741 she'd still be alive today
t2__260.741-262.491 because well this is years ago
t2__262.491-264.459 of course i made these comments
t2__264.459-266.866 because that would have removed
t2__266.866-270.584 her from the danger that was present on that
t2__270.584-272.834 main road somme parade hm
t2__272.834-275.427 well it wasn't a main road it was
t2__275.427-277.708 a feeder road
t2__277.708-280.114 ah and we'd have all lived in the country and
t2__280.114-281.239 ah well not that it wa~
t2__281.239-282.770 you know it wasn't that far out
t2__282.770-284.458 it was up by virginia lake
t2__284.458-285.864 i don't know whether you know wanganui much but
t2__285.864-287.177 i don't really know it at all
t2__288.646-289.677 so after all that you said that
t2__289.677-290.709 you said that
t2__290.709-292.490 grandpop didn't let you
t2__292.490-295.115 like he kept the family together how
t2__295.115-298.678 oh well he of course people
t2__298.678-300.553 al~ always come forward
t2__300.553-301.678 and offer to take
t2__301.678-302.834 some of the children
t2__302.834-304.334 yeah how many of how many were there
t2__304.334-306.920 well there was five of us five
