and and although they weren't .\\
very religious necessarily\\
I'd I think they were --\\

an official religion or something but -\\
of course . if .\\
a Arthur Pepper and Fred were .\\
out of England -\\
\textless mmm\textgreater  they'd come from England .\\

Arthur who was our -\\
Barry and I's grandfather --\\
he - was a um -- [click]\\
he was always a builder\\
and had a very successful building company\\
and had all his sons in it \textless mmm\textgreater }

\turn{interviewer}{\textless and\textgreater  which is why grandpop was a builder\\
and ah . grandpop .\\
did his trade .\\
not with Pepper but with -\\
ah the Wanganui Sash and Door company --\\
and he was more of a mmm\\
what did they used to call them\\
not a fitter and turner\\
but he was more of a cabinet maker\\
oh yeah}

\turn{participant}{and then he worked because he -\\
he was impressed with Mother -\\
\textless hm\textgreater  he hung around for years --\\
right through the depression\\
and the parent .\\
the Pepper parents -\\
were wealthy -\\

and um . he ah -\\
but he kept hanging around and -\\
the father took .\\
the girls because of course there were .\\
three or four girls in the family .\\
Mother . Thelma was the eldest -\\
he took them all to Fiji or somewhere\\
for a long holiday trying to shake off .\\
this guy August Fromont \textless yeah\textgreater \\
and um --\\
because August was a devout Catholic .\\
and had been bought by .\\
a very strict French grandmother\\
who was a devout Catholic -\\
and he became a very devout\\
Catholic himself of course but . um .\\
ah they weren't all that keen about\\
the Catholicism thing \textless mmm\textgreater \\
ah and he had nothing .\\
he he had a motorbike\\
he didn't have anything else .\\
he owned some property\\
in the Petone foreshore .\\
w ah as he\\
saved up some money he bought property\\
but during the depression\\
they were out of work\\
and he couldn't keep the payments up\\
so he lost the property \textless mmm\textgreater \\
and they grew potatoes on it\\
so he used to tell us\\
just as a cash crop you know ?\\
\textless mmm\textgreater  but of course he lost the property -\\
and whatever he'd built up for himself - as --\\
financial background backing\\
cos he had nothing at all --\\

died when he was five -\\
grandpops father had been killed on the railway\\
