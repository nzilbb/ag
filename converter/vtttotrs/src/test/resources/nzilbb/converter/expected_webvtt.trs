<Sync time="1.849"/>Before we move to the first question to the First Minister, I invite the First Minister
<Sync time="6.430"/>to make a few remarks following the tragic events in Christchurch in New Zealand.
<Sync time="9.879"/>The First Minister (Nicola Sturgeon): Thank you, Presiding Officer. I begin today
<Sync time="13.600"/>with heartfelt condolences to the people of New Zealand after last week’s appalling
<Sync time="18.450"/>terrorist attack in Christchurch. I hope that people in New Zealand can take some comfort
<Sync time="24.010"/>from the knowledge that people across the world stand in solidarity with them.
<Sync time="28.740"/>Events in New Zealand have been felt deeply here in Scotland, as in other countries, and
<Sync time="34.000"/>perhaps especially in our Muslim community. Last week, Police Scotland arranged reassurance
<Sync time="39.649"/>patrols and visits to mosques and other places of worship. On Friday, I visited Glasgow central
<Sync time="44.979"/>mosque with the justice secretary.
<Sync time="48.159"/>The Prime Minister of New Zealand has said that nations around the world are engaged
<Sync time="53.089"/>in a global fight against far-right, racist and extremist ideology. Regrettably, she is
<Sync time="59.889"/>absolutely right. All of us have a responsibility to engage in that fight. We must tackle hatred
<Sync time="66.850"/>and prejudice through the words that we use, the actions that we take and the climate that
<Sync time="71.729"/>we create. I know that all parties in this chamber will play their part in doing that.
<Sync time="76.619"/>In the past week, we have also seen an attack in Utrecht and the stabbing of a teenager
<Sync time="81.969"/>in Surrey. Our condolences are with all those who have been affected by those incidents
<Sync time="86.420"/>as well.
<Sync time="87.579"/>Let us today express sympathy and solidarity with the victims of racist and extremist violence
<Sync time="93.060"/>in Christchurch and around the world. Above all, let us make clear our determination that
<Sync time="99.310"/>the proponents of hate will be defeated by the values of kindness, compassion and love.
<Sync time="107.340"/>[Applause.]
<Sync time="109.560"/>The Presiding Officer: We turn to questions to the First Minister,
<Sync time="117.710"/>the first of which is from Jackson Carlaw.
<Sync time="118.710"/>Jackson Carlaw (Eastwood) (Con): I associate all of us in the Scottish Conservatives
<Sync time="123.719"/>with the First Minister’s remarks and offer our support for any measures that are required
<Sync time="128.030"/>to reassure those who attend mosques in Scotland.
<Sync time="132.620"/>Many Scots will have friends and family who live in or regularly visit New Zealand and
<Sync time="137.420"/>who will have been deeply affected. However, for many in Scotland’s Muslim community,
<Sync time="141.670"/>events on the other side of the world must never have felt closer to home. As we embrace
<Sync time="146.250"/>them with our good wishes and condolences, we must—as the First Minister said—work
<Sync time="150.090"/>together to think afresh about what must be done by us all to counter this defining 21st
<Sync time="156.280"/>century scourge.
<Sync time="159.750"/>Over the past 10 years, the Scottish National Party Government has launched two major drug
<Sync time="163.360"/>strategies. Tragically, during those 10 years drug deaths have doubled. We are now on course
<Sync time="169.110"/>to have the largest number of drug deaths per head anywhere in Europe. Does the First
<Sync time="174.590"/>Minister believe that the strategies have been a success or a failure?
<Sync time="178.360"/>The First Minister (Nicola Sturgeon): These are challenging issues and I readily
<Sync time="182.680"/>concede that this Government—any Government—must remain open to fresh thinking and new ideas.
<Sync time="190.230"/>The situation with regard to drug deaths is not one that any of us would consider to be
<Sync time="196.090"/>acceptable. However, as I said in the chamber last week, many of those who have died have
<Sync time="203.840"/>lived with alcohol and drug use for a long time—such people become more vulnerable
<Sync time="208.200"/>as they grow older as a result of their complex health and social needs. Although I do not
<Sync time="215.920"/>overstate the point, more encouraging is the fact that the last report showed fewer deaths
<Sync time="220.080"/>among the under-25 population. Recent reports also highlight falling heroin use—again,
<Sync time="226.630"/>particularly among under-25s.
<Sync time="227.680"/>As I am sure that Jackson Carlaw is aware, work is under way in Dundee and Glasgow to
<Sync time="234.090"/>consider what more can be done to tackle drug deaths. That work will be of relevance around
<Sync time="239.690"/>Scotland, but we want to see the outcomes from it before we consider what further action
<Sync time="244.300"/>we should take.
<Sync time="246.210"/>Jackson Carlaw: We all want to sort the crisis, but the first
<Sync time="250.920"/>step is surely to admit that the current policy is not working as it should. Regrettably,
<Sync time="255.330"/>it has been a failure. I have an example of that.
<Sync time="258.190"/>We know that rehabilitation services in prisons can be vital in turning around people’s
<Sync time="262.810"/>lives. However, my colleague Adam Tomkins has discovered in recent days that in Barlinnie,
<Sync time="266.280"/>which is one of our biggest prisons, a successful voluntary project—a recovery cafe where
<Sync time="272.090"/>people can go to get their lives back on track—is facing closure. How can it be right that we
<Sync time="278.200"/>prioritise spending millions of pounds on methadone programmes, yet successful projects
<Sync time="284.730"/>such as the cafe are put at risk?
<Sync time="286.080"/>The First Minister: First, I say to Jackson Carlaw and to Adam
<Sync time="293.400"/>Tomkins that the justice secretary has received a letter on the issue, which will be responded
<Sync time="298.490"/>to in due course.
<Sync time="299.570"/>It is important that I advise members that the Scottish Government has not previously
<Sync time="304.600"/>funded recovery cafes. However, we provide funding for the Scottish Recovery Consortium,
<Sync time="311.560"/>and the Scottish Prison Service adopts a therapeutic approach in dealing with addiction issues
<Sync time="316.830"/>and provides support for those with addiction problems who are in their care.
<Sync time="320.790"/>The new alcohol and drug strategy highlights the importance of recovery communities and
<Sync time="325.240"/>the need for them to be at the heart of any proposals. They help to reduce stigma, because
<Sync time="330.850"/>they provide the visible face of recovery, as well as insights into addiction and harm.
<Sync time="336.190"/>Through our sustained funding of the Scottish Recovery Consortium, we will continue to do
<Sync time="341.010"/>what we can to support the growth of recovery communities across the country.
<Sync time="344.900"/>We will of course give consideration to the points that Adam Tomkins made in his letter.
<Sync time="350.910"/>Jackson Carlaw: My question was not intended as a criticism
<Sync time="353.400"/>of that mix of approaches.
<Sync time="354.400"/>Just a few miles from Parliament is Castle Craig hospital near West Linton, which is
<Sync time="357.670"/>a drug rehabilitation centre with capacity for residential drug rehab patients, and which
<Sync time="362.590"/>the Conservative health spokesman, Miles Briggs, visited recently. Hospital staff told him
<Sync time="365.320"/>that Castle Craig is not receiving national health service referrals and is mostly kept
<Sync time="369.970"/>going by patients who are referred from the Netherlands for treatment. Is not the First
<Sync time="375.441"/>Minister, like me, concerned that Dutch patients are getting better access to that rehabilitation
<Sync time="381.080"/>project here in Scotland than local Scots who are in need of the same support and treatment?
<Sync time="385.930"/>The First Minister: I am very happy to look into that specific
<Sync time="391.840"/>example. We want people to have access to a broad range of rehabilitation services.
<Sync time="401.050"/>The Scottish Government is providing £70 million this financial year to reduce the
<Sync time="406.410"/>harms that are caused by alcohol and drugs. That includes an additional £20 million for
<Sync time="412.750"/>drug and alcohol services, which is being allocated to support new approaches, so that
<Sync time="417.150"/>we respond in a much more joined-up and person-centred way. Such investment is important.
<Sync time="427.000"/>I am not trying to make a party-political point about a very serious issue, but it is
<Sync time="431.160"/>also important that we are prepared to take forward innovative and evidence-based new
<Sync time="436.460"/>approaches, even if at first they seem to be challenging, particularly for public opinion.
<Sync time="442.790"/>That is why we supported the principles behind Glasgow’s proposals for a medically supervised
<Sync time="447.980"/>safer drug consumption facility and heroin-assisted treatment in the city. It is important that
<Sync time="453.230"/>we work with health and social care partnerships on new approaches, as well as ensuring that
<Sync time="458.360"/>we invest in rehabilitation. I hope that the Conservatives will think about giving us support
<Sync time="463.620"/>on that, because we need to persuade the United Kingdom Government to do what is required.
<Sync time="468.230"/>Jackson Carlaw: I respect the First Minister’s approach
<Sync time="471.680"/>to that policy. We have looked at it, but, unfortunately, it is the one policy in this
<Sync time="474.669"/>area on which we fundamentally disagree. We think that the policy should be to get people
<Sync time="478.810"/>clean of drugs, not to provide opportunities for people to take them.
<Sync time="482.870"/>Scottish Conservatives have set out a clear plan to tackle Scotland’s growing drugs
<Sync time="487.870"/>crisis, which is to get first-time offenders into treatment, direct more money into rehabilitation
<Sync time="492.699"/>programmes run by third sector bodies and, at the same time, at least review the failed
<Sync time="498.900"/>methadone programme.
<Sync time="499.900"/>Let us admit that, in politics at the moment, we are not overrun with issues on which we
<Sync time="506.240"/>can form consensus. However, on this one vital issue, will the First Minister commit today
<Sync time="511.630"/>to working across the chamber—we will commit to that—to improve the drugs strategy for
<Sync time="515.990"/>the next 10 years, so that we can cut drug deaths and drug addiction and come down hard
<Sync time="522.159"/>on those peddling misery in our communities?
<Sync time="524.529"/>The First Minister: I reiterate my willingness to work across
<Sync time="530.810"/>the chamber. I think that I have said in a couple of my responses today that I will consider
<Sync time="535.600"/>the points that Jackson Carlaw has raised, and I give that reassurance again. I ask for
<Sync time="540.589"/>the same in return. I am slightly concerned at the almost knee-jerk way in which Jackson
<Sync time="546.480"/>Carlaw ruled out the fresh thinking around safer drug consumption facilities. If we are
<Sync time="552.459"/>genuinely to try and find a consensus, we have to be open to new thinking, and that
<Sync time="557.040"/>will sometimes be very tough and challenging. I appeal to Jackson Carlaw to reconsider his
<Sync time="563.189"/>opposition to that policy, just as he is asking me to be open-minded to any proposals that
<Sync time="567.170"/>he makes.
<Sync time="568.290"/>We will continue to ensure that we have the right strategies in place to deal with what
<Sync time="573.110"/>we all accept is a challenging and complex issue. First, that involves taking a very
<Sync time="578.360"/>hard line against those who supply drugs—and we saw figures earlier this week about police
<Sync time="582.660"/>seizures of drugs. Secondly, it definitely involves support, particularly rehabilitation
<Sync time="588.720"/>support, for those who are addicted to drugs. Thirdly, it involves being open to new ideas
<Sync time="594.249"/>and new thinking. If we can all agree broadly around that approach, perhaps we can build
<Sync time="599.879"/>a consensus that allows us to tackle something that we all agree is unacceptable. We want
<Sync time="606.139"/>to see a considerably improved situation, and I hope that we have the support of Jackson
<Sync time="610.940"/>Carlaw and the Conservatives on that.
<Sync time="614.839"/>Richard Leonard (Central Scotland) (Lab): I add the deep-felt condolences of the Scottish
<Sync time="620.309"/>Labour Party to the families and friends of all those who lost their lives in the terror
<Sync time="625.040"/>attack in Christchurch last Friday. I offer our support for practical action to defeat
<Sync time="633.259"/>racism and hatred wherever it occurs.
<Sync time="638.009"/>To ask the First Minister why there is a staffing crisis in the national health service.
<Sync time="643.009"/>The First Minister (Nicola Sturgeon): There is not a staffing crisis in the national
<Sync time="647.779"/>health service. There are record numbers of people working in the national health service.
<Sync time="652.869"/>In fact, I can tell Richard Leonard that staffing levels in NHS Scotland are now at a record
<Sync time="660.100"/>high and are up by more than 13,600 since 2006, just before this Government took office.
<Sync time="669.709"/>The number of consultants is up by 51 per cent; the number of qualified nurses and midwives
<Sync time="675.839"/>is up by 8 per cent; and there is a higher level of NHS staffing per head in Scotland
<Sync time="680.540"/>than there is in NHS England.
<Sync time="682.769"/>Our NHS staff of course work under considerable pressure, and we are grateful to them for
<Sync time="687.929"/>the job that they do, but we will continue to invest in our NHS to ensure that there
<Sync time="692.629"/>are record numbers of staff, so that they can continue to deliver the excellent services
<Sync time="697.269"/>that they do.
<Sync time="698.269"/>Richard Leonard: This week, the Parliament’s Health and Sport
<Sync time="703.790"/>Committee, following the tragic events at the Queen Elizabeth university hospital, began
<Sync time="709.019"/>its inquiry into infection control standards. New figures released to Scottish Labour this
<Sync time="715.800"/>week reveal that the number of domestic staff—that is, cleaners—who are employed at the Queen
<Sync time="721.220"/>Elizabeth university hospital is falling. In March 2018, 464 cleaners were employed
<Sync time="730.480"/>at the hospital. According to the latest figures, that number has dropped to 440. Why, at the
<Sync time="739.980"/>very point when it is facing a rise in infection outbreaks, is Scotland’s biggest hospital
<Sync time="747.889"/>employing fewer people on the front line whose job it is to keep that hospital clean and
<Sync time="754.379"/>safe?
<Sync time="755.489"/>The First Minister: I am sure that Richard Leonard will have heard
<Sync time="760.649"/>the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport already address this issue publicly. The issue
<Sync time="764.730"/>has been raised with Greater Glasgow and Clyde NHS Board. It is absolutely imperative that
<Sync time="769.699"/>all health boards in all hospitals ensure appropriate numbers of domestic and cleaning
<Sync time="774.620"/>staff.
<Sync time="775.620"/>It is of course for health boards to consider the configuration of staffing. As Richard
<Sync time="780.670"/>Leonard will know, and as those of us who represent Glasgow constituencies know particularly
<Sync time="785.279"/>well, there has been a significant change in the configuration of Glasgow hospitals
<Sync time="789.470"/>over the past number of years, and the overall staffing numbers will undoubtedly reflect
<Sync time="794.889"/>that.
<Sync time="797.869"/>We will continue to raise issues directly with health boards to ensure that they are
<Sync time="802.899"/>addressed where that is necessary. Notwithstanding the very serious incidents at the Queen Elizabeth
<Sync time="808.130"/>university hospital, which we have discussed on many occasions in the chamber before—and
<Sync time="811.759"/>I welcome the Health and Sport Committee’s inquiry into these issues—infection rates
<Sync time="816.040"/>are down considerably in Scottish hospitals overall.
<Sync time="821.319"/>I see that Jackie Baillie is in the chamber. She and I regularly used to have exchanges
<Sync time="827.420"/>about the levels of Clostridium difficile in our hospitals, following the tragic incident
<Sync time="830.949"/>at the Vale of Leven hospital. C diff, MRSA and infections generally are down, in some
<Sync time="835.579"/>cases by more than 80 per cent.
<Sync time="838.079"/>Let us tackle issues where they arise—Richard Leonard is right to raise them—but let us
<Sync time="843.629"/>not lose sight of the good work that has been done in our NHS to reduce infection and to
<Sync time="848.470"/>put a real focus on patient safety.
<Sync time="850.949"/>Richard Leonard: I should also make it clear that the problem
<Sync time="855.679"/>is not unique to one hospital: it is replicated right across the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde
<Sync time="861.499"/>area. There are fewer domestics, porters and laundry and linen staff compared with last
<Sync time="868.569"/>year’s levels. It is clear that we have a staffing crisis in our health service, and
<Sync time="873.989"/>that it is not confined to consultants, nurses and midwives but extends to facilities staff,
<Sync time="879.649"/>domestics, catering workers, porters and laundry staff—all workers without whom no hospital
<Sync time="887.749"/>can operate.
<Sync time="890.329"/>We know that there is a parliamentary inquiry and that reviews are being carried out by
<Sync time="894.649"/>the health board and the Government. However, these issues are serious and urgent. The public,
<Sync time="902.889"/>and the staff who are under pressure, need to hear a commitment that the reduction in
<Sync time="908.519"/>such vital front-line jobs will be reversed as soon as possible. Is the First Minister
<Sync time="913.949"/>prepared to give them that commitment today?
<Sync time="917.029"/>The First Minister: As I said earlier, we will continue to work
<Sync time="921.799"/>with health boards, including NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, to ensure that they have
<Sync time="924.680"/>appropriate staffing levels across all specialties in the NHS. That is important. I repeat what
<Sync time="931.779"/>I have already said: record numbers of staff are working in our national health service.
<Sync time="936.389"/>Richard Leonard says that the issues are urgent, and I could not agree more. I know how devastating
<Sync time="941.509"/>outbreaks of infection in hospitals are—principally for patients and their families, but also
<Sync time="945.879"/>for the staff who work there. That is why the Healthcare Environment Inspectorate’s
<Sync time="951.449"/>report on the Queen Elizabeth university hospital, which was commissioned and instructed by the
<Sync time="953.889"/>Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport, has already been completed, and why its recommendations
<Sync time="959.269"/>have already been accepted by the health board and are being implemented.
<Sync time="964.800"/>Whatever disagreements we might have, and whatever legitimate points Richard Leonard
<Sync time="969.429"/>might raise—they are legitimate points—I do not think that anybody could doubt the
<Sync time="973.920"/>seriousness of the Government and the health service when it comes to tackling infections
<Sync time="979.799"/>in our hospitals. Overall, the figures state that things are going in the right direction,
<Sync time="986.100"/>but that does not take away from the need to tackle serious incidents when they arise.
<Sync time="990.579"/>We will continue to do exactly that.
<Sync time="992.670"/>The Presiding Officer: We turn to constituency supplementary questions,
<Sync time="996.589"/>the first of which is from Liam Kerr.
<Sync time="998.920"/>Liam Kerr (North East Scotland) (Con): Cove harbour fishing community is suffering.
<Sync time="1003.259"/>First, its landing was bought—and closed—by a private landlord. It went to court and won
<Sync time="1008.179"/>rights of public access but faced significant legal costs. Several boats were then destroyed
<Sync time="1012.259"/>in a fire, and now the landlord has closed access to the beach. Community representatives
<Sync time="1016.069"/>have written to the Cabinet Secretary for the Rural Economy, Fergus Ewing, several times,
<Sync time="1018.829"/>requesting a meeting—even if that were to be here at Holyrood—to discuss their rights
<Sync time="1022.759"/>and their future, but to no avail.
<Sync time="1024.530"/>Will the First Minister ask the cabinet secretary to meet those representatives, and not risk
<Sync time="1028.649"/>ignoring a community that faces the loss of its livelihood?
<Sync time="1030.799"/>The First Minister (Nicola Sturgeon): Of course, the Scottish Government wants to
<Sync time="1034.579"/>do everything possible to help any community that is experiencing difficulties. Beyond
<Sync time="1040.399"/>what the member has just said, I am not aware of the content of the correspondence with
<Sync time="1043.110"/>Fergus Ewing, but I am happy to give an undertaking to look into that and, if the cabinet secretary
<Sync time="1047.829"/>thinks that the Scottish Government can offer help, for him to meet those who are affected.
<Sync time="1051.730"/>Dr Alasdair Allan (Na h-Eileanan an Iar) (SNP): Earlier this week, the Office of Gas and Electricity
<Sync time="1057.530"/>Markets announced that it was minded to reject proposals for a 600MW transmission link to
<Sync time="1062.649"/>the Western Isles, saying that it would instead support a much-reduced 450MW link. That has
<Sync time="1068.970"/>been met with extreme disappointment in my constituency, because it will severely constrain
<Sync time="1072.990"/>capacity for future community projects and place other existing projects from the Western
<Sync time="1076.920"/>Isles at a potential disadvantage.
<Sync time="1079.590"/>What pressure can the Scottish Government put on Ofgem, and the United Kingdom Government,
<Sync time="1083.940"/>to reconsider that short-sighted decision?
<Sync time="1084.940"/>The First Minister (Nicola Sturgeon): The Scottish Government is absolutely committed
<Sync time="1089.549"/>to unlocking the vast renewables potential of our islands and the associated economic
<Sync time="1094.669"/>benefits for our island communities. We are very concerned at the uncertainty over the
<Sync time="1099.190"/>proposed connection from the Western Isles. The Government believes that for the islands’
<Sync time="1103.620"/>full renewables potential to be realised, a larger link is required, so I very much
<Sync time="1108.669"/>agree with the sentiment of Alasdair Allan’s question. We have made arguments directly
<Sync time="1113.101"/>to Ofgem to support that point, and we will continue to do so as we engage further with
<Sync time="1118.010"/>it and with island stakeholders and developers during the on-going consultation process.
<Sync time="1123.929"/>I assure Alasdair Allan—and the chamber—that we will make absolutely every effort to secure
<Sync time="1129.100"/>the right outcome for the Western Isles.
<Sync time="1131.500"/>Jackie Baillie (Dumbarton) (Lab): The First Minister will be aware that my constituent
<Sync time="1137.450"/>Jagtar Singh Johal has spent more than 500 days detained in prison in the Punjab. There
<Sync time="1143.299"/>have been accusations of torture and he has now faced his 77th pre-trial preliminary hearing.
<Sync time="1149.690"/>His MP, Martin Docherty-Hughes, is to be commended for pursuing the matter vigorously.
<Sync time="1155.350"/>Will the First Minister use her influence and speak to the Foreign Secretary and the
<Sync time="1159.919"/>United Kingdom Government to urge them to provide support and assistance to Mr Johal
<Sync time="1164.519"/>and his family?
<Sync time="1165.519"/>The First Minister (Nicola Sturgeon): I thank Jackie Baillie for raising this issue.
<Sync time="1168.929"/>I know that she has raised it previously and she is right to say that Martin Docherty-Hughes
<Sync time="1174.750"/>MP has been assiduous in raising the rights and situation of his constituent.
<Sync time="1179.929"/>We have raised this issue and we will continue to do so. The Deputy First Minister has raised
<Sync time="1183.880"/>it directly with Indian ministers on recent visits to India and with the British high
<Sync time="1190.730"/>commission. I believe—although I will double-check this—that we have raised the issue directly
<Sync time="1195.390"/>with the Foreign Office. If not, I am happy to undertake that we will do so.
<Sync time="1202.450"/>Miles Briggs (Lothian) (Con): In recent weeks, I have received correspondence
<Sync time="1205.880"/>from families across Scotland who are facing unacceptable waits for cleft surgery. Two
<Sync time="1210.191"/>years ago, we warned Scottish National Party ministers about the impact of the closure
<Sync time="1213.880"/>of the Edinburgh unit and the centralisation of cleft services. This Parliament voted against
<Sync time="1218.929"/>centralisation, but ministers pressed on against the will of Parliament.
<Sync time="1222.870"/>One case highlighted to me just this week is that of a young man who has been waiting
<Sync time="1226.820"/>two years for a promised final surgery and is no further forward on when he will receive
<Sync time="1232.170"/>that. Families are also telling me that they are looking to NHS England in order to receive
<Sync time="1236.440"/>the surgery. Will the First Minister apologise to families for those waits? What will she
<Sync time="1241.070"/>do to correct the mistake that this Government made?
<Sync time="1243.880"/>The First Minister (Nicola Sturgeon): As I have said many times before in the chamber,
<Sync time="1246.960"/>I regret it when any patient has to wait longer for treatment than we would want to be the
<Sync time="1252.740"/>case.
<Sync time="1253.740"/>On the issue of cleft surgery, as I recall, the redesign of that service was on clinical
<Sync time="1258.980"/>grounds, to ensure a quality and safe service. If Miles Briggs would like to give further
<Sync time="1265.470"/>details of the constituents who are raising issues with him, the Cabinet Secretary for
<Sync time="1268.610"/>Health and Sport will look into those and, once she has had the opportunity to do that,
<Sync time="1273.659"/>will correspond further with him.
<Sync time="1276.200"/>Patrick Harvie (Glasgow) (Green): On behalf of the Scottish Greens, I join others
<Sync time="1281.200"/>in expressing our shared concern for the bereaved and injured following the far-right terrorist
<Sync time="1288.169"/>attack in New Zealand, but also our respect for the response that that country is showing,
<Sync time="1295.000"/>recommitting to the values of its inclusive society and refusing to placate the far right,
<Sync time="1302.039"/>as far too many politicians around the world have done.
<Sync time="1307.600"/>Last night, in the midst of a crisis of her own making, the Prime Minister again refused
<Sync time="1312.779"/>to listen to reason and instead effectively told the public that Parliament is their enemy.
<Sync time="1320.480"/>Scotland needs the freedom to take a different direction, leave behind this chaos and find
<Sync time="1326.750"/>our own way out of the crisis. That is why we need our independence. The First Minister
<Sync time="1333.029"/>told us that she would say something about her preferred timing within weeks. That was
<Sync time="1338.279"/>two months ago. I ask again, when?
<Sync time="1343.159"/>The First Minister (Nicola Sturgeon): First, I agree with Patrick Harvie that the
<Sync time="1347.279"/>Prime Minister’s comments last night were deeply irresponsible and I hope that, in time,
<Sync time="1352.860"/>she will reflect on that.
<Sync time="1354.519"/>The Prime Minister’s comments also failed to accept any of the responsibility that she
<Sync time="1359.540"/>bears for the mess that the United Kingdom is in right now. She wanted to blame everybody
<Sync time="1365.789"/>except herself, and yet I think that most people know that it was the Prime Minister
<Sync time="1370.159"/>who triggered article 50 without a plan. It was the Prime Minister who drew self-defeating,
<Sync time="1375.230"/>contradictory red lines that boxed her in from the start. It was the Prime Minister
<Sync time="1378.570"/>who called an unnecessary general election and who delayed the first vote on her deal
<Sync time="1383.759"/>in an attempt to run down the clock. It was the Prime Minister who failed to listen and
<Sync time="1387.620"/>change course after the first defeat of her deal and then again after the second. She
<Sync time="1392.810"/>must change course now before it is too late and she must bear responsibility for the mess
<Sync time="1398.610"/>that this country is in.
<Sync time="1400.720"/>On the issue of independence, the frustration that people feel right now at Scotland’s
<Sync time="1406.350"/>future being determined by the Democratic Unionist Party and a cabal of right-wing Tories
<Sync time="1411.700"/>is understandable, and I absolutely share it. I said that I would wait until the end
<Sync time="1417.820"/>of this phase of the Brexit negotiations before setting out my views on the way forward for
<Sync time="1422.879"/>Scotland. Having done so this long, I think that it is reasonable for me to wait to see
<Sync time="1428.409"/>what clarity emerges in the next few days, even if I suspect that it will just be clarity
<Sync time="1433.730"/>that there will be no clarity. I will then set out my views on the path forward.
<Sync time="1441.540"/>Nobody can be in any doubt that change is needed. The past three years have shown that
<Sync time="1447.100"/>the status quo is broken. It cannot protect Scotland from the folly of Brexit and all
<Sync time="1453.299"/>that flows from that. Even the most ardent unionist must see that the way we are now
<Sync time="1458.650"/>governed by Westminster is broken. The question is how we fix that for the future, and there
<Sync time="1465.039"/>is no doubt in my mind that letting people in Scotland choose an independent future is
<Sync time="1470.019"/>the best way to do that.
<Sync time="1474.530"/>Patrick Harvie: At every stage of this nightmare, this Parliament
<Sync time="1484.259"/>has tried to persuade the Prime Minister to change course. We have called for the narrow
<Sync time="1489.600"/>2016 result and Scotland’s remain vote to be respected, for our place in the single
<Sync time="1495.879"/>market to be protected and for the public to have the right of a final say and the chance
<Sync time="1501.390"/>to cancel this crisis. If the Prime Minister succeeds in closing off all those positive
<Sync time="1508.649"/>choices and the country finds itself being driven to the edge of the cliff at this time
<Sync time="1514.850"/>next week, does the First Minister agree that MPs must be prepared, finally, to put the
<Sync time="1522.320"/>public interest first and willing, if all else fails, to do what is necessary and revoke
<Sync time="1528.379"/>article 50?
<Sync time="1529.379"/>The First Minister: Yes. Indeed, the Scottish National Party at
<Sync time="1534.620"/>Westminster and the Greens, the Liberal Democrats and Plaid Cymru issued a joint statement last
<Sync time="1539.700"/>night to that effect. SNP MPs will not vote for the Prime Minister’s deal, because it
<Sync time="1545.940"/>is a bad deal that will damage Scottish interests. I do not think that any Scottish MP should
<Sync time="1551.639"/>vote for such a deal. However, nor will we accept the Prime Minister framing it as a
<Sync time="1556.390"/>choice between her deal and no deal. Just because she is not willing to contemplate
<Sync time="1562.889"/>the alternatives does not mean that there are no alternatives. One of those alternatives
<Sync time="1568.429"/>is, undoubtedly, revoking article 50. If all else fails by this time next week, that is
<Sync time="1575.529"/>exactly what MPs should do.
<Sync time="1580.230"/>Willie Rennie (North East Fife) (LD): I associate myself and my party with the First
<Sync time="1584.941"/>Minister’s remarks about New Zealand. The events in that country were truly sickening.
<Sync time="1589.820"/>You would not think that we were in the middle of a national crisis if you just listened
<Sync time="1594.420"/>to the questions from the leaders of the Conservative and Labour parties, but the last thing this
<Sync time="1601.019"/>country needs is more division and chaos with independence to compound the division and
<Sync time="1607.020"/>chaos of Brexit. [Interruption.]
<Sync time="1611.549"/>The Presiding Officer: Order, please.
<Sync time="1612.549"/>Willie Rennie: The first duty of a Prime Minister is to keep
<Sync time="1616.009"/>the country safe but, because of the cavalier choices of this Prime Minister, emergency
<Sync time="1622.679"/>measures under operation yellowhammer have been triggered and medicines, food supply
<Sync time="1628.810"/>chains and transport are all at risk. Does the First Minister agree that no serious Prime
<Sync time="1634.460"/>Minister should ever threaten such catastrophic consequences, no matter how much she wants
<Sync time="1641.090"/>her policy to be agreed?
<Sync time="1643.580"/>The First Minister (Nicola Sturgeon): Before I address Willie Rennie’s question,
<Sync time="1644.933"/>I say in response to the first part of what he said that the inconsistency in his position
<Sync time="1650.720"/>is this: he wants people across the United Kingdom to have the ability to escape Brexit
<Sync time="1656.289"/>through a second referendum—and I agree with him on that—but if that does not prove
<Sync time="1660.940"/>to be possible, he thinks that Scotland should just grin and bear it, and put up with the
<Sync time="1665.029"/>devastation of Brexit, instead of Scotland having the choice to escape Brexit and have
<Sync time="1671.020"/>an independent future. That is a deeply inconsistent position for him to take and I hope that he
<Sync time="1677.159"/>will reflect on it.
<Sync time="1680.559"/>On operation yellowhammer, which is the emergency planning for a no-deal Brexit, it is beyond
<Sync time="1690.159"/>comprehension that any Prime Minister could knowingly allow the country to be eight days—about
<Sync time="1697.610"/>200 hours—away from the possibility of crashing out of the European Union without a deal and
<Sync time="1704.299"/>to require that emergency planning work to be done. Yesterday, as I have done once a
<Sync time="1710.019"/>week for several weeks, I chaired a meeting of the Scottish Government’s resilience
<Sync time="1713.370"/>committee that was looking at medicine supplies, food supplies and transport links in the event
<Sync time="1719.010"/>of a no-deal Brexit. It is outrageous that we have to expend time, energy and resources
<Sync time="1725.950"/>on doing that. Before any more time passes and it is too late, the Prime Minister must
<Sync time="1733.639"/>change course, take no deal off the table completely, look to build a broader consensus
<Sync time="1740.220"/>rather than pandering to the hardliners in her own party and, if necessary, dump Brexit
<Sync time="1746.470"/>completely. That would be in the best interests of the country.
<Sync time="1749.809"/>Willie Rennie: The First Minister is wrong. The inconsistency
<Sync time="1754.249"/>is to believe that breaking up an economic partnership of 40 years will be chaotic but
<Sync time="1760.759"/>that breaking up one of 300 years will be a piece of cake. [Interruption.]
<Sync time="1764.269"/>The Presiding Officer: Order, please.
<Sync time="1765.269"/>Willie Rennie: The First Minister is the inconsistent one.
<Sync time="1766.700"/>[Interruption.]
<Sync time="1767.700"/>The Presiding Officer: Order, please.
<Sync time="1768.700"/>Willie Rennie: People are scunnered by this agonising Brexit
<Sync time="1772.000"/>process. We are three years on, with 200 hours left. Is it not time for a commonsense approach
<Sync time="1779.740"/>under which the Prime Minister takes a no-deal Brexit off the table instead of using it as
<Sync time="1788.309"/>a threat against her own citizens; all party leaders sit down and talk instead of the leader
<Sync time="1796.070"/>of the Opposition walking out because he does not like Chuka Umunna; the Prime Minister
<Sync time="1800.990"/>reaches out to MPs in Parliament rather than insulting them from behind a podium in number
<Sync time="1807.020"/>10; and we admit that Parliament is incapable of deciding, so we have a public vote to let
<Sync time="1815.009"/>the people decide? Is it not time for that commonsense approach?
<Sync time="1819.299"/>The First Minister: Yes, I agree with all that. I think that people
<Sync time="1825.082"/>across the UK should have the opportunity to vote again, given everything that they
<Sync time="1830.090"/>now know that was not known in 2016. That is why I will be calling for that public vote
<Sync time="1835.620"/>in London on Saturday, along with many others—no doubt, hundreds of thousands of others.
<Sync time="1843.140"/>I agree with everything that the member said about the Prime Minister, and I share his
<Sync time="1846.669"/>despair about the leader of the Labour Party and his childish behaviour last night at a
<Sync time="1851.150"/>time when we need people to come together to find an alternative. Where I disagree with
<Sync time="1856.789"/>the member is on his view that, if all of what he has just called for fails, Scotland
<Sync time="1862.230"/>is powerless in the face of the disaster of Brexit. I oppose Brexit, as he does, but there
<Sync time="1868.250"/>was nothing inevitable about the chaos of Brexit. That is down to those who proposed
<Sync time="1874.190"/>it having no idea what it would look like in reality and doing no planning for it. It
<Sync time="1878.800"/>did not have to be that way.
<Sync time="1882.700"/>I say to Willie Rennie that the inconsistency is in him standing up to rightly spell out
<Sync time="1887.430"/>what a disaster Brexit will be but then saying that, if all else fails, Scotland just has
<Sync time="1892.990"/>to put up with it. I do not think that Scotland has to put up with it and I do not think that
<Sync time="1896.950"/>Scotland should have to put up with it. If it comes to it, Scotland choosing independence
<Sync time="1901.020"/>is a much brighter future than remaining part of Brexit Britain.
<Sync time="1904.271"/>The Presiding Officer: We have some additional supplementaries.
<Sync time="1911.470"/>Jenny Gilruth (Mid Fife and Glenrothes) (SNP): Last night, the Prime Minister claimed that
<Sync time="1916.360"/>the public have had enough; today, a petition on the UK Parliament website calling for article
<Sync time="1921.440"/>50 to be revoked is already well on the way to 1 million signatures. Support is growing
<Sync time="1926.889"/>so fast that the website crashed harder than the Prime Minister’s credibility. If the
<Sync time="1932.649"/>Prime Minister believes that the people are with her, should she not have the courage
<Sync time="1936.350"/>to put that to the test and call for a people’s vote?
<Sync time="1939.510"/>The First Minister (Nicola Sturgeon): Yes, I agree. As I said, I thought that the
<Sync time="1944.230"/>Prime Minister’s statement last night was deeply regrettable. For her to blame everybody
<Sync time="1949.749"/>except herself beggars belief. Now is the time for people across parties to speak out.
<Sync time="1956.509"/>Last night, I watched one of the most powerful contributions that I have ever seen in the
<Sync time="1963.529"/>House of Commons. It was from Dominic Grieve, a moderate Tory who I think everybody would
<Sync time="1965.190"/>accept is an honourable person. He had the honesty to say that he was ashamed to be in
<Sync time="1971.179"/>the Conservative Party and that the conduct of the Prime Minister made him want to weep,
<Sync time="1975.669"/>yet Scottish Conservatives continue to parrot the lines of the Prime Minister. I often wonder
<Sync time="1981.990"/>whether Jackson Carlaw ever, in his quieter moments, thinks that it might be better for
<Sync time="1988.080"/>the country and indeed his own reputation for him to say what I believe he probably
<Sync time="1993.920"/>thinks—that this is a mess, that carrying on regardless is a profound mistake and that
<Sync time="1998.850"/>the Prime Minister must change course and must do so now before it is too late.
<Sync time="2004.529"/>Daniel Johnson (Edinburgh Southern) (Lab): The First Minister will be aware that the
<Sync time="2011.389"/>British Retail Consortium annual crime survey was published today. It records that, last
<Sync time="2016.419"/>year, 115 shop workers were physically attacked at work every single day across the United
<Sync time="2021.309"/>Kingdom. The Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers—USDAW—estimates that the
<Sync time="2024.269"/>real problem could be much greater; its estimate is that 34 retail workers are attacked every
<Sync time="2028.860"/>day in Scotland alone.
<Sync time="2030.960"/>My bill to protect shop workers is in the final stages of drafting. What does the First
<Sync time="2035.490"/>Minister think needs to be done to tackle this growing problem and will her Government
<Sync time="2040.749"/>work with me to look at what changes in the law may be needed to do so? Everyone has the
<Sync time="2045.470"/>right to be safe at work, whether they work in an office or on a shop floor.
<Sync time="2048.869"/>The First Minister (Nicola Sturgeon): I thank Daniel Johnson for raising the issue
<Sync time="2054.250"/>and the results of the British Retail Consortium’s survey. It is a powerful reminder that our
<Sync time="2060.020"/>shop workers do an essential job that is often dangerous to them, for which we all owe them
<Sync time="2066.520"/>a huge debt of gratitude.
<Sync time="2068.340"/>We will be happy to work with Daniel Johnson and others to look at what further protections
<Sync time="2072.790"/>we need to put in place. He said that his bill is in the final stages of drafting; we
<Sync time="2077.710"/>will look carefully at it when it is published and we will be happy to consider it and discuss
<Sync time="2083.390"/>it with him. We will be happy to try to build consensus.
<Sync time="2088.429"/>Mark McDonald (Aberdeen Donside) (Ind): On 1 April, employer contributions to national
<Sync time="2092.550"/>health service pension schemes will increase from 14.9 to 20.9 per cent. Children’s hospices
<Sync time="2099.100"/>across Scotland have estimated that the increased cost to them will be equivalent to the salaries
<Sync time="2103.110"/>of nine full-time nurses. The United Kingdom Government has stated that funding for charities
<Sync time="2107.250"/>and hospices is included in the funding that has been provided to NHS England to cover
<Sync time="2110.980"/>the costs of the increase, but the Children’s Hospice Association Scotland says that similar
<Sync time="2113.200"/>commitments have not yet been made to Scottish charities and hospices. Will the Scottish
<Sync time="2118.530"/>Government provide funding to help charities and hospice organisations to meet the cost
<Sync time="2121.920"/>increase and ensure that they do not have to divert money from the vital support services
<Sync time="2125.810"/>that they provide?
<Sync time="2126.810"/>The First Minister (Nicola Sturgeon): I thank Mark McDonald for rightly raising
<Sync time="2129.540"/>the issue, which is concerning generally and in particular for hospices and charities.
<Sync time="2137.060"/>The Scottish Government has been in discussions with the British Medical Association about
<Sync time="2141.170"/>how best to disburse additional funding to practices to meet the change. We will continue
<Sync time="2147.340"/>to discuss that, and I will ask the health secretary to look at the position of hospices
<Sync time="2151.530"/>and charities and to come back to Mark McDonald when she has done so.
<Sync time="2156.520"/>Christine Grahame (Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale) (SNP):
<Sync time="2159.690"/>To ask the First Minister, in light of the reported travel chaos on the Borders railway
<Sync time="2163.990"/>last weekend as a result of a number of train cancellations, whether the Scottish Government
<Sync time="2168.930"/>considers that the ScotRail franchise continues to be sustainable. (S5F-03189)
<Sync time="2172.720"/>The First Minister (Nicola Sturgeon): I am disappointed that passengers across a
<Sync time="2176.050"/>number of routes on the ScotRail network continue to be affected by train cancellations as a
<Sync time="2180.810"/>consequence of ScotRail’s training backlog. There is evidence of some improvement in ScotRail’s
<Sync time="2186.630"/>performance nationally, but that will do little to reassure passengers who attempted to travel
<Sync time="2191.200"/>on the Borders railway last Sunday and were faced with an unacceptable number of cancellations.
<Sync time="2195.780"/>That is why ScotRail’s focus must remain on delivering a robust remedial plan that
<Sync time="2200.270"/>puts passenger interests at the forefront of restoring performance levels. The remedial
<Sync time="2204.080"/>plan has been specifically designed to militate against train crew and train fleet challenges,
<Sync time="2209.220"/>and I fully expect ScotRail to ensure that the plan is delivered in order to reaffirm
<Sync time="2213.110"/>passenger confidence in the railway.
<Sync time="2215.220"/>Christine Grahame: There was, indeed, a service meltdown. It
<Sync time="2218.690"/>was a breakdown, too—on the Borders railway on Sunday. The cancellations continued since
<Sync time="2227.730"/>then and continue today.
<Sync time="2229.440"/>I heard the Cabinet Secretary for Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity talking this
<Sync time="2231.180"/>morning about remedial notices. The second notice that was served requires that a plan
<Sync time="2235.690"/>be delivered soon. The plan might be delivered, but it will not deliver trains—plans do
<Sync time="2241.510"/>not drive trains. Is not it time that the Scottish Government told Abellio ScotRail
<Sync time="2246.820"/>that it is in the last chance saloon? I certainly think so, and so do my constituents.
<Sync time="2252.270"/>The First Minister: ScotRail should treat the remedial plan very
<Sync time="2259.600"/>much as the last chance saloon. That is the nature of it. ScotRail has been left in no
<Sync time="2266.590"/>doubt that its recent performance levels, particularly in the Borders and Fife, have
<Sync time="2271.051"/>been completely unacceptable. I have said that in the chamber and I heard Michael Matheson
<Sync time="2275.210"/>say it a short while ago, when members including Annabelle Ewing raised legitimate and understandable
<Sync time="2281.480"/>concerns on their constituents’ behalf.
<Sync time="2284.090"/>We have used contractual mechanisms that are in the franchise agreement to require the
<Sync time="2288.400"/>remedial plan. ScotRail will publish its performance remedial plan on its website shortly. The
<Sync time="2294.560"/>commitments in that plan have been contracted as a remedial agreement. Of course, if ScotRail
<Sync time="2300.840"/>does not achieve improved performance, or if it fails to deliver on its contractual
<Sync time="2304.940"/>commitments, it runs the risk of its franchise being terminated early.
<Sync time="2308.730"/>Rachael Hamilton (Ettrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire) (Con):
<Sync time="2312.530"/>I recently received a letter from a concerned Borders railway commuter. His letter says:
<Sync time="2317.500"/>“It has come to the point where there is genuine surprise that the train is running
<Sync time="2321.650"/>on time as opposed to it being so frequently cancelled ... The negative effects of this
<Sync time="2327.750"/>are significant, there is a financial penalty imposed by the nursery as a result of collecting
<Sync time="2333.130"/>my daughter”
<Sync time="2334.130"/>late, and
<Sync time="2335.130"/>“There is significant stress and anxiety because of the lateness at work”.
<Sync time="2339.220"/>Will the First Minister apologise on behalf of her transport secretary to the hundreds
<Sync time="2343.970"/>of commuters who are experiencing transport hell, and will she personally oversee the
<Sync time="2349.480"/>remedial plan that has been submitted by ScotRail, and which will be published in the next few
<Sync time="2354.370"/>days?
<Sync time="2355.370"/>The First Minister: The transport secretary will oversee that,
<Sync time="2357.920"/>because it is part of his responsibilities. However, as First Minister, I, too, will obviously
<Sync time="2364.000"/>retain a very close interest in the matter.
<Sync time="2366.520"/>I have made it very clear—I do not think that I can make it clearer—that some of
<Sync time="2370.290"/>ScotRail’s recent performance levels have been completely unacceptable. That is particularly,
<Sync time="2375.100"/>although not exclusively, the case on the Borders railway. I could stand here and talk
<Sync time="2379.320"/>about some of the reasons for that, including train delivery and training requirements.
<Sync time="2383.290"/>There have also been problems with trains coming into and going out of Edinburgh in
<Sync time="2391.420"/>the past couple of days to do with Network Rail failings. However, I am not going to
<Sync time="2394.640"/>talk about those reasons, because it is ScotRail’s responsibility to ensure that it lives up
<Sync time="2399.720"/>to its performance standards. That is why the remedial plan is so important and why
<Sync time="2405.210"/>ScotRail has to understand the seriousness of the obligation on it to deliver on the
<Sync time="2410.840"/>commitments that it makes in the plan.
<Sync time="2412.480"/>Mark Ruskell (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Green): Commuters are suffering from poor rail services
<Sync time="2416.250"/>across Scotland, especially in Fife. Last year, the then Minister for Transport and
<Sync time="2420.730"/>the Islands, Humza Yousaf, said in the chamber:
<Sync time="2423.361"/>“there will be an upgrade in the rolling stock later in 2018 or early in 2019. Nevertheless,
<Sync time="2429.640"/>people in Fife should not have to wait for that to get an improvement in their service”.—[Official
<Sync time="2432.960"/>Report, 25 January 2018; c 2.]
<Sync time="2434.320"/>Why are Fife commuters now being told that it will be the end of 2019 at the very earliest
<Sync time="2439.830"/>before any improvements come through? Does not the First Minister believe that it is
<Sync time="2443.360"/>time that she personally stepped in to take charge of the ScotRail crisis?
<Sync time="2447.260"/>The First Minister: I have made my views clear, and I will do
<Sync time="2451.410"/>so again. Those who are charged with and remunerated for the responsibility of running our railways
<Sync time="2459.000"/>are the ones who have to get that right. They have a responsibility to do so and to begin
<Sync time="2467.100"/>immediately to deliver the improvements that passengers want. That is what the remedial
<Sync time="2471.560"/>plan will focus very much on.
<Sync time="2473.760"/>Of course, significant investment is being made in our railways, with rolling stock being
<Sync time="2479.610"/>renewed and a lot of other positive work being done from which I hope passengers will start
<Sync time="2483.940"/>to benefit very soon. However, ScotRail must address the reasons for the dip in its performance—at
<Sync time="2490.940"/>least, those that are within its responsibility—and we expect it to do so very quickly.
<Sync time="2498.640"/>Liz Smith (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con): To ask the First Minister, in light of the
<Sync time="2502.130"/>parliamentary reports by both MSPs and MPs, what the Scottish Government's response is
<Sync time="2507.620"/>to the growing concerns about the effects of social media on the mental health of young
<Sync time="2511.880"/>people across Scotland. (S5F-03169)
<Sync time="2513.160"/>The First Minister (Nicola Sturgeon): We welcome the report that was published last
<Sync time="2516.370"/>week by the Public Audit and Post-legislative Scrutiny Committee on the relationship between
<Sync time="2519.910"/>social media and mental health. It made recommendations on the need for further research in the area.
<Sync time="2525.420"/>Next month, we will publish initial research on the links between unhealthy social media
<Sync time="2530.340"/>use and lower mental wellbeing, in particular in girls and young women. We are also committed
<Sync time="2536.090"/>to developing and publishing Scotland-specific advice on how young people can use social
<Sync time="2540.190"/>media in a healthy way. That advice, which will be co-produced with young people for
<Sync time="2544.230"/>young people, will be informed by the research that we will publish next month.
<Sync time="2548.730"/>Liz Smith: I thank the First Minister for that helpful
<Sync time="2552.150"/>answer. I am sure that the whole Parliament will be united in deep concern about the shocking
<Sync time="2557.880"/>statistics that say that 60 per cent of 16 to 25-year-olds believe that social media
<Sync time="2564.260"/>place “overwhelming pressure” on their age group, and that mental health referrals
<Sync time="2569.330"/>have increased by 22 per cent since 2014. Those are just some of the facts that have,
<Sync time="2574.500"/>quite rightly, led MSPs and MPs to state categorically that we all have a duty of care to protect
<Sync time="2580.470"/>vulnerable users. In addition to her previous answer, can the First Minister give us some
<Sync time="2587.570"/>details about the timescale that she envisages for implementing the task force delivery plan?
<Sync time="2594.560"/>The First Minister: First, I appreciate very much the sentiments
<Sync time="2601.230"/>behind, and the detail of, Liz Smith’s question. The internet and social media should be, and
<Sync time="2605.630"/>in many respects are, forces for good that we should embrace and welcome, but they also
<Sync time="2612.210"/>put considerable pressure on young people—in particular, young girls. Many of us have young
<Sync time="2619.940"/>girls in our families—I have a niece who is about to enter her teenage years—and
<Sync time="2623.020"/>it is not difficult to see that pressure. We must ensure that our young people are equipped
<Sync time="2629.740"/>to deal with it properly.
<Sync time="2632.000"/>I have referred to research that we will publish and work that will flow from it. The task
<Sync time="2638.320"/>force is taking forward a substantial programme of work. I will ask the Minister for Mental
<Sync time="2643.832"/>Health to write to Liz Smith with the precise timescales for delivery of the various aspects
<Sync time="2648.900"/>of the work. All that work is important, so that we can prevent mental health issues and
<Sync time="2654.400"/>provide treatment as quickly as possible, when it is required. Undoubtedly, part of
<Sync time="2657.610"/>prevention is encouragement of, and support for, healthy use of social media.
<Sync time="2662.580"/>Willie Coffey (Kilmarnock and Irvine Valley) (SNP):
<Sync time="2664.950"/>The First Minister will be aware of the tragic death of a young 18-year-old girl in Kilmarnock
<Sync time="2670.200"/>last weekend, which was followed only hours later by the death of another youngster in
<Sync time="2675.340"/>Ayrshire. I understand that there are no suspicious circumstances. A growing number of young people
<Sync time="2681.240"/>across Ayrshire seem to be ending their lives through suicide, which is clearly heartbreaking
<Sync time="2687.090"/>for their families and friends. Will the First Minister offer some hope to youngsters and
<Sync time="2692.510"/>their families by saying that services are there to help, and that if more can be done
<Sync time="2697.290"/>to help to put an end to such awful tragedies, it will be done?
<Sync time="2702.510"/>The First Minister: I give that assurance. I will not comment
<Sync time="2706.650"/>on individual cases, beyond saying that my thoughts and condolences are with the families
<Sync time="2710.840"/>involved. East Ayrshire Council is already looking at the incidents with the national
<Sync time="2716.360"/>health service, and will want to ensure that it responds appropriately.
<Sync time="2720.180"/>Across the chamber, we are committed to ensuring that, as the challenges around mental health
<Sync time="2730.350"/>change and develop, our responses do so, too. I have said previously in the chamber that,
<Sync time="2735.190"/>as the system has developed over many years, too many people are referred to specialist
<Sync time="2740.920"/>services because there are not services in the community for prevention and early intervention.
<Sync time="2747.370"/>Many of the initiatives that we are implementing through the investment that we announced recently
<Sync time="2751.882"/>are trying to redress that balance, so that there is a focus on prevention and early intervention,
<Sync time="2757.280"/>and so that we ensure that we also have specialist services when young people need them. I hope
<Sync time="2762.830"/>and believe that that programme of work has wide support across the chamber.
<Sync time="2766.970"/>The Presiding Officer: That concludes First Minister’s question
<Sync time="2770.510"/>time. Before we move on to the members’ business debate, we will have a short suspension
<Sync time="2777.960"/>to allow members, ministers and people in the gallery to change seats.
