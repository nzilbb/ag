<v 1>and he couldn't keep the payments up</v>

113
00:04:15.611 --> 00:04:17.751
<v 1>so he lost the property <mmm></v>

114
00:04:17.751 --> 00:04:20.282
<v 1>and they grew potatoes on it</v>

115
00:04:20.282 --> 00:04:21.407

<v 1>just as a cash crop you know ?</v>

117
00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:25.531
<v 1><mmm> but of course he lost the property -</v>

118
00:04:25.531 --> 00:04:30.468
<v 1>and whatever he'd built up for himself - as --</v>

119
00:04:30.468 --> 00:04:32.218
<v 1>financial background backing</v>

120
00:04:32.218 --> 00:04:34.186
<v 1>cos he had nothing at all --</v>

121
00:04:34.186 --> 00:04:36.529

00:04:41.715 --> 00:04:42.871
<v 1><yeah yeah> when he was five</v>

125
00:04:42.871 --> 00:04:43.965
