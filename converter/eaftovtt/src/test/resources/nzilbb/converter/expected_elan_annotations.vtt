00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.750

2
00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:06.907
<v 1>with this letter for Mum</v>

3
00:00:06.907 --> 00:00:09.126
<v 1>and and then there was a message .</v>

00:00:09.126 --> 00:00:12.126
<v 1>and I think they both had telephones .</v>

5
00:00:12.126 --> 00:00:13.220
<v 1>ah at that time</v>

6
00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:16.033
<v 1>we certainly had a telephone at our place --</v>

7
00:00:16.033 --> 00:00:18.315
<v 1>and I think Molly always had a telephone so .</v>

8
00:00:18.315 --> 00:00:19.236
<v 1>then I suppose</v>

9
00:00:19.236 --> 00:00:20.423
<v 1>there was a phone call to say</v>

10
00:00:20.423 --> 00:00:21.985
<v 1>oh yeah yeah and we'll see you there</v>

11
00:00:21.985 --> 00:00:23.563
<v 1>or whatever <mmm> you know -</v>

12
00:00:23.563 --> 00:00:25.501
<v 1>but then Molly walked in .</v>

13
00:00:25.501 --> 00:00:27.533
<v 1>and immediately I grabbed Molly</v>

14
00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:30.440
<v 1>because I knew se she was so close .</v>

15
00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.003
<v 1>and I told her all about it .</v>

16
00:00:32.003 --> 00:00:34.535

00:00:45.505 --> 00:00:50.006
<v 1>he was you know -- so -</v>

24
00:00:50.006 --> 00:00:51.631
<v 1>I don't know how we got back there</v>

25
00:00:51.631 --> 00:00:53.225
<v 1>whether we got a taxi or .</v>

26
00:00:53.225 --> 00:00:54.319
<v 1>the priests ran us up .</v>

27
00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:55.444
<v 1>you know because .</v>

28
00:00:55.444 --> 00:01:00.101
<v 1>the township's quite a long from where we lived in --</v>

29
00:01:00.101 --> 00:01:04.851
<v 1>and ah -- shit --</v>

30
00:01:04.851 --> 00:01:06.664
<v 1>and I remember -</v>

31
00:01:06.664 --> 00:01:10.195
<v 1>she came home and tried to console Dad and -</v>

32
00:01:10.195 --> 00:01:12.633
<v 1>he said oh she's just cooked me a cake</v>

33
00:01:12.633 --> 00:01:14.039
<v 1>for my fiftieth birthday</v>

34
00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:16.476
<v 1>which was on the bench <mmm> -</v>

<v 1>and um --</v>

36
00:01:19.726 --> 00:01:21.101
<v 1>at a certain stage .</v>

37
00:01:21.101 --> 00:01:22.538
<v 1>I had to go .</v>

38
00:01:22.538 --> 00:01:23.975
<v 1>the same night I think</v>

39
00:01:23.975 --> 00:01:25.163
<v 1>after I'd seen Molly</v>

40
00:01:25.163 --> 00:01:26.726

41
00:01:26.726 --> 00:01:28.070
<v 1>to my to our place</v>

42
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.508
<v 1>to k try to find .</v>

<v 1>pop and . console him --</v>

44
00:01:32.367 --> 00:01:35.461
<v 1>and I . had to go back with the police .</v>

45
00:01:35.461 --> 00:01:38.742

80
00:02:54.168 --> 00:02:57.590

<v 1>learned all the . disaster --</v>

82
00:03:01.652 --> 00:03:03.995
<v 0>goodness</v>

<v 0>well I turned it over --</v>

88
00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.025
<v 0>I thought it might be something to do with</v>

89
00:03:15.025 --> 00:03:17.181
<v 0>where it was on the tape</v>

90
00:03:17.181 --> 00:03:18.275
<v 1>I must go and have a leak you know</v>

91
00:03:18.275 --> 00:03:19.213
<v 1>if you'll excuse me</v>

92
00:03:19.213 --> 00:03:21.775

<v 0>see if I can figure out what that light was</v>

94
00:03:25.415 --> 00:03:26.415
<v 1>well I think you should .</v>

95
00:03:26.415 --> 00:03:27.790
<v 1>listen to it because o</v>

96
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.977
<v 1>very often when you're recording -</v>

97
00:03:29.977 --> 00:03:31.837
<v 1>if you don't listen to them pretty quickly</v>

98
00:03:31.837 --> 00:03:32.806
<v 1>you bloody find out</v>

99
00:03:32.806 --> 00:03:34.822
<v 1>that the microphone is malfunctioning</v>

100
00:03:34.822 --> 00:03:38.290
<v 1>or some and there's nothing much on it or</v>

101
00:03:34.822 --> 00:03:38.290
<v 0>yeah yeah yeah -- well that's right</v>

00:03:40.696 --> 00:03:43.227
<v 0>ah yeah just turn left there</v>

104
00:03:49.852 --> 00:03:53.727
<v 1>that - Mum and Dad had looked at a house.</v>

105
00:03:53.727 --> 00:03:56.946
<v 1>in the country --</v>

106
00:03:56.946 --> 00:03:59.039
<v 1>on the main road which</v>

107
00:03:59.039 --> 00:04:02.788
<v 1>was driving towards Taranaki --</v>

108
00:04:02.788 --> 00:04:05.069
<v 1>and it was a . country house -</v>

109
00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:06.413
<v 1>with a long drive in</v>

110
00:04:06.413 --> 00:04:08.834
<v 1>you know over the field and .</v>

111
00:04:08.834 --> 00:04:10.522
<v 1>into the house . and .</v>

112
00:04:10.522 --> 00:04:13.147
<v 1>and I'd said to Barry once or twice gosh .</v>

113
00:04:13.147 --> 00:04:16.928
<v 1>if they'd bought that house --</v>

114
00:04:16.928 --> 00:04:19.053
<v 1>when they first looked at it -</v>

115
00:04:19.053 --> 00:04:20.741
<v 1>she'd still be alive today</v>

116
00:04:20.741 --> 00:04:22.491
<v 1>because well this is years ago</v>

117
00:04:22.491 --> 00:04:24.459
<v 1>of course I made these comments -</v>

118
00:04:24.459 --> 00:04:26.866
<v 1>because . that would have removed .</v>

119
00:04:26.866 --> 00:04:30.584
<v 1>her from the danger that was present on that .</v>

120

00:04:35.427 --> 00:04:37.708
<v 1>a feeder road --</v>

123
00:04:37.708 --> 00:04:40.114
<v 1>ah and we'd have all lived in the country and .</v>

124
00:04:40.114 --> 00:04:41.239
<v 1>ah well not that it wa~</v>
