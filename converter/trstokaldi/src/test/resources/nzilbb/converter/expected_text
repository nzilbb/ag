t1 and ah cyril would arrive at the door
t1 with this letter for mum
t1 and and then there was a message
t1 and i think they both had telephones
t1 ah at that time
t1 we certainly had a telephone at our place
t1 and i think molly always had a telephone so
t1 then i suppose
t1 there was a phone call to say
t1 oh yeah yeah and we'll see you there
t1 or whatever mmm you know
t1 but then molly walked in
t1 and immediately i grabbed molly
t1 because i knew se she was so close
t1 and i told her all about it
t1 yeah and ah
t1 ah and i said come quick come quick
t1 dad's at home
t1 and he's a hell of a mess
t1 yeah sort of words you know yeah
t1 which he was he was beside himself
t1 well inconsolable i imagine
t1 he was you know so
t1 i don't know how we got back there
t1 whether we got a taxi or
t1 the priests ran us up
t1 you know because
t1 the township's quite a long from where we lived in
t1 and ah shit
t1 and i remember
t1 she came home and tried to console dad and
t1 he said oh she's just cooked me a cake
t1 for my fiftieth birthday
t1 which was on the bench mmm
t1 and um
t1 at a certain stage
t1 i had to go
t1 the same night i think
t1 after i'd seen molly
t1 i think she went
t1 to my to our place
t1 to k try to find
t1 pop and console him
t1 and i had to go back with the police
t1 to to um
t1 to identify mum right
t1 and um
t1 and that was very difficult
t1 yeah
t1 but later i got back home
t1 and i remember
t1 molly had gone and dad was
t1 there but s you know very
t1 depressed as shit and so on
t1 and barry was just coming back from
t1 camp he was at ohakia as a
t1 he was in the air force
t1 at that time
t1 he did air force training as an eighteen year old and
t1 he he was there
t1 and he arrived back
t1 with one of his friends
t1 and i remember going out to the front
t1 ah of the house
t1 beside the garage
t1 and of course you know he'd just come in
t1 to wanganui and
t1 didn't know a bloody thing
t1 and i said to him
t1 barry barry come in
t1 dad wants to talk to you
t1 and so his friend said oh well
t1 oh see you later you know and
t1 rode away on his bike or whatever he had
t1 a motorbike or something
t1 or a car
t1 and of course you know
t1 it was just barry and i
t1 there were no other children at that time mmm
t1 so he came in and
t1 learned all the disaster
t1 goodness
t1 and have you got all that
t1 well the funny light hasn't gone on
t1 again
t1 did you switch it off or what
t1 well i turned it over
t1 i thought it might be something to do with
t1 where it was on the tape
t1 i must go and have a leak you know
t1 if you'll excuse me
t1 okay
t1 see if i can figure out what that light was
t1 well i think you should
t1 listen to it because o
t1 very often when you're recording
t1 if you don't listen to them pretty quickly
t1 you bloody find out
t1 that the microphone is malfunctioning
t1 or some and there's nothing much on it or
t1 now where is it in the back left
t1 yeah yeah yeah well that's right
t1 ah yeah just turn left there
t1 that mum and dad had looked at a house
t1 in the country
t1 on the main road which
t1 was driving towards taranaki
t1 and it was a country house
t1 with a long drive in
t1 you know over the field and
t1 into the house and
t1 and i'd said to barry once or twice gosh
t1 if they'd bought that house
t1 when they first looked at it
t1 she'd still be alive today
t1 because well this is years ago
t1 of course i made these comments
t1 because that would have removed
t1 her from the danger that was present on that
t1 main road somme parade hm
t1 well it wasn't a main road it was
t1 a feeder road
t1 ah and we'd have all lived in the country and
t1 ah well not that it wa~
t1 you know it wasn't that far out
t1 it was up by virginia lake
t1 i don't know whether you know wanganui much but
t1 i don't really know it at all
t1 so after all that you said that
t1 you said that
t1 grandpop didn't let you
t1 like he kept the family together how
