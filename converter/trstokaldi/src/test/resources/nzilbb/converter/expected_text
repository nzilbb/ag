t1__25.501-27.533 and immediately i grabbed molly
t1__27.533-30.440 because i knew se she was so close

t1__207.790-209.977 very often when you're recording

t1__211.837-212.806 you bloody find out
t1__212.806-214.822 that the microphone is malfunctioning

t1__248.834-250.522 into the house and
t1__250.522-253.147 and i'd said to barry once or twice gosh
