and ah cyril would arrive at the door
with this letter for mum
and and then there was a message
and i think they both had telephones
ah at that time
we certainly had a telephone at our place
and i think molly always had a telephone so
then i suppose
there was a phone call to say
oh yeah yeah and we'll see you there
or whatever mmm you know
but then molly walked in
and immediately i grabbed molly
because i knew se she was so close
and i told her all about it
yeah and ah
ah and i said come quick come quick
dad's at home
and he's a hell of a mess
yeah sort of words you know yeah
which he was he was beside himself
well inconsolable i imagine
he was you know so
i don't know how we got back there
whether we got a taxi or
the priests ran us up
you know because
the township's quite a long from where we lived in
and ah shit
and i remember
she came home and tried to console dad and
he said oh she's just cooked me a cake
for my fiftieth birthday
which was on the bench mmm
and um
at a certain stage
i had to go
the same night i think
after i'd seen molly
i think she went
to my to our place
to k try to find
pop and console him
and i had to go back with the police
to to um
to identify mum right
and um
and that was very difficult
yeah
but later i got back home
and i remember
molly had gone and dad was
there but s you know very
depressed as shit and so on
and barry was just coming back from
camp he was at ohakia as a
he was in the air force
at that time
he did air force training as an eighteen year old and
he he was there
and he arrived back
with one of his friends
and i remember going out to the front
ah of the house
beside the garage
and of course you know he'd just come in
to wanganui and
didn't know a bloody thing
and i said to him
barry barry come in
dad wants to talk to you
and so his friend said oh well
oh see you later you know and
rode away on his bike or whatever he had
a motorbike or something
or a car
and of course you know
it was just barry and i
there were no other children at that time mmm
so he came in and
learned all the disaster
goodness
and have you got all that
well the funny light hasn't gone on
again
did you switch it off or what
well i turned it over
i thought it might be something to do with
where it was on the tape
i must go and have a leak you know
if you'll excuse me
okay
see if i can figure out what that light was
well i think you should
listen to it because o
very often when you're recording
if you don't listen to them pretty quickly
you bloody find out
that the microphone is malfunctioning
or some and there's nothing much on it or
now where is it in the back left
yeah yeah yeah well that's right
ah yeah just turn left there
that mum and dad had looked at a house
in the country
on the main road which
was driving towards taranaki
and it was a country house
with a long drive in
you know over the field and
into the house and
and i'd said to barry once or twice gosh
if they'd bought that house
when they first looked at it
she'd still be alive today
because well this is years ago
of course i made these comments
because that would have removed
her from the danger that was present on that
main road somme parade hm
well it wasn't a main road it was
a feeder road
ah and we'd have all lived in the country and
ah well not that it wa~
you know it wasn't that far out
it was up by virginia lake
i don't know whether you know wanganui much but
i don't really know it at all
so after all that you said that
you said that
grandpop didn't let you
like he kept the family together how
oh well he of course people
al~ always come forward
and offer to take
some of the children
yeah how many of how many were there
well there was five of us five
