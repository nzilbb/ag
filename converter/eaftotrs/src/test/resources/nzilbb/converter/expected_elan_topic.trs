<Sync time="12.126"/>ah at that time
<Sync time="13.220"/>we certainly had a telephone at our place --
<Sync time="16.033"/>and I think Molly always had a telephone so .

<Sync time="19.236"/>there was a phone call to say
<Sync time="20.423"/>oh yeah yeah and we'll see you there
<Sync time="21.985"/>or whatever &lt;mmm&gt; you know -
<Sync time="23.563"/>but then Molly walked in .
<Sync time="25.501"/>and immediately I grabbed Molly
<Sync time="27.533"/>because I knew se she was so close .
<Sync time="30.440"/>and I told her all about it .
<Sync time="32.003"/>&lt;yeah&gt; and ah -
