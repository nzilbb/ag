<Sync time="79.971"/>and and although they weren't .
<Sync time="82.252"/>very religious necessarily
<Sync time="84.158"/>I'd I think they were --
<Sync time="86.049"/>they were Anglican maybe
<Sync time="87.517"/>and maybe they didn't really have a -
<Sync time="89.235"/>an official religion or something but -
<Sync time="92.141"/>of course . if .
<Sync time="93.485"/>a Arthur Pepper and Fred were .
<Sync time="95.922"/>out of England -
<Sync time="97.671"/>&lt;mmm&gt; they'd come from England .
<Sync time="99.171"/>to . establish --
<Sync time="101.514"/>whatever {unclear} and their family.
<Sync time="103.201"/>and so on . and

<Sync time="118.292"/>things with barges on the Wanganui river
<Sync time="120.479"/>and all that sort of thing -
<Sync time="121.885"/>and of course if

</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="140.366" endTime="159.457">
<Sync time="140.366"/>&lt;and&gt; which is why grandpop was a builder
<Sync time="142.053"/>and ah . grandpop .
<Sync time="144.147"/>did his trade .
<Sync time="145.584"/>not with Pepper but with -
<Sync time="148.459"/>ah the Wanganui Sash and Door company --
<Sync time="151.489"/>and he was more of a mmm
<Sync time="154.614"/>what did they used to call them
<Sync time="155.708"/>not a fitter and turner
<Sync time="156.770"/>but he was more of a cabinet maker

<Sync time="169.736"/>the Pepper parents -
<Sync time="171.454"/>were wealthy -

<Sync time="214.152"/>this guy August Fromont &lt;yeah&gt;
<Sync time="217.058"/>and um --

<Sync time="224.807"/>a very strict French grandmother
<Sync time="227.119"/>who was a devout Catholic -
<Sync time="229.274"/>and he became a very devout
<Sync time="231.649"/>Catholic himself of course but . um .
<Sync time="235.023"/>ah they weren't all that keen about
