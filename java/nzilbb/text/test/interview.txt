 she - um -- was - 
 fairly - um -- 
 what's the word ah 
 well she they were a very correct family - <mmm> 
 and and although they weren't . 
 very religious necessarily 
 I'd I think they were -- 
 they were Anglican maybe 
 and maybe they didn't really have a - 
 an official religion or something but - 
 of course . if . 
 a Arthur Pepper and Fred were . 
 out of England - 
 <mmm> they'd come from England . 
 to . establish -- 
 whatever    {unclear} and their family. 
 and so on . and 
 lived in New Zealand and --

 um plumber guy - 
 ah but had he was a ah 
 a much a very much of an entrepreneur 
 also and did th 
 things with barges on the Wanganui river 
 and all that sort of thing - 
 and of course if 
 Arthur who was our - 
Barry and I's grandfather -- 
 he - was a um    --  [click]
 he was always a builder 
 and had a very successful building company 
 and had all his sons in it <mmm> 

Interviewer mop03-2b:  <and> which is why grandpop was a builder 
 and ah . grandpop . 
 did his trade . 
  not with Pepper but with -  
 ah the Wanganui Sash and Door company -- 
 and he was more of a mmm 
 what did they used to call them 
 not a fitter and turner 
 but he was more of a cabinet maker 
 oh yeah 

mop03-2b:  and then he worked because he - 
 he was impressed with Mother - 
 <hm> he hung around for years -- 
 right through the depression 
 and the parent . 
 the Pepper parents - 
 were wealthy - 
 and here was a young fellow -- 
 ah who rode a motorbike <hm> - 
 which wasn't exactly the thing to be done <no>

 the father took . 
 the girls because of course there were . 
 three or four girls in the family . 
 Mother . Thelma was the eldest - 
 he took them all to Fiji or somewhere 
 for a long holiday trying to shake off . 
  this guy August Fromont <yeah> 
 and um -- 
 because August was a devout Catholic . 
 and had been bought by .  
 a very strict French grandmother 
 who was a devout Catholic - 
 and he became a very devout 
 Catholic himself of course but . um . 
 ah they weren't all that keen about 
 the Catholicism thing <mmm> 
 ah and he had nothing . 
 he he had a motorbike 
 he didn't have anything else . 
 he owned some property 
 in the Petone foreshore . 
 w ah as he 
 saved up some money he bought property 
 but during the depression 
 they were out of work 
 and he couldn't keep the payments up 
 so he lost the property <mmm> 
 and they grew potatoes on it 
 so he used to tell us 
 just as a cash crop you know ? 
 <mmm> but of course he lost the property - 
 and whatever he'd built up for himself - as -- 
 financial background backing 
 cos he had nothing at all -- 
 ah - and his own father 
 died when he was five - 
 grandpops father had been killed on the railway
