participant:  and ah . Cyril would arrive at the door
 with this letter for Mum
 and and then there was a message .
 and I think they both had telephones .
 ah at that time
 we certainly had a telephone at our place --
 and I think Molly always had a telephone so .
 then I suppose
 there was a phone call to say
 oh yeah yeah and we'll see you there
 or whatever <mmm> you know -
 but then Molly walked in .
 and immediately I grabbed Molly
 because I knew se she was so close .
 and I told her all about it .
 <yeah> and ah -
 ah . and I said come quick come quick .
 Dad's at home
 and he's a hell of a mess
 <yeah> sort of words you know ? <yeah>
 which he was he was beside himself

interviewer:  well inconsolable I imagine

participant:  he was you know -- so -
 I don't know how we got back there
 whether we got a taxi or .
 the priests ran us up .
 you know because .
 the township's quite a long from where we lived in --
 and ah -- shit --
 and I remember -
 she came home and tried to console Dad and -
 he said oh she's just cooked me a cake
 for my fiftieth birthday
 which was on the bench <mmm> -
 and um --
 at a certain stage .
 I had to go .
 the same night I think
 after I'd seen Molly
 I think she went -
 to my to our place
 to k try to find .
 pop and . console him --
 and I . had to go back with the police .
 to . to um --
 to identify Mum - <right> -
 and um --
 and that was very difficult -

interviewer:  yeah --

participant:  but later I got back home .
 and I remember --
 Molly had gone and Dad was --
 there but s you know . very -
 depressed as shit and so on -
 and Barry was just coming back from -
 camp he was at Ohakia . as a -
 he was in the . air force -
 at that time .
 he did air force training as an eighteen year old and .
 he . he was there -
 and he arrived back -
 with one of his friends .
 and I remember going out to the . front -
 ah of the house
 beside the garage
 and of course you know he'd just come in .
 to Wanganui and .
 didn't know a bloody thing
 and I said to him
 Barry Barry come in .
 Dad wants to talk to you --
 and so his friend said oh . well .
 oh see you later you know and .
 rode away on his bike or whatever he had .
 a motorbike or something -
 or a car -
 and of course . you know .
 it was just Barry and I
 there were no other children at that time - <mmm> --
 so he came in and - --
 learned all the . disaster --

interviewer:  goodness

participant:  and have you got all that ?

interviewer:   well the funny light hasn't gone on -
 again

participant:  did you switch it off or what ?

interviewer:  well I turned it over --
 I thought it might be something to do with
 where it was on the tape

participant:  I must go and have a leak you know
 if you'll excuse me

interviewer:  okay --
 see if I can figure out what that light was

participant:  well I think you should .
 listen to it because o
 very often when you're recording -
 if you don't listen to them pretty quickly
 you bloody find out
 that the microphone is malfunctioning
 or some and there's nothing much on it or 

interviewer:  yeah yeah yeah -- well that's right

participant:  now where is it in the back left ?

interviewer:  ah yeah just turn left there

participant:  that - Mum and Dad had looked at a house.
 in the country --
 on the main road which
 was driving towards Taranaki --
 and it was a . country house -
 with a long drive in
 you know over the field and .
 into the house . and .
 and I'd said to Barry once or twice gosh .
 if they'd bought that house --
 when they first looked at it -
 she'd still be alive today
 because well this is years ago
 of course I made these comments -
 because . that would have removed .
 her from the danger that was present on that .
 main road Somme parade <hm>
 well it wasn't a main road it was --
 a feeder road --
 ah and we'd have all lived in the country and .
 ah well not that it wa~
 you know it wasn't that far out -
 it was up by Virginia Lake .
 I don't know whether you know Wanganui much but

interviewer:  I don't really know it at all
  -- 
 so after all that you said that .
 you said that .
 grandpop didn't let you.
 like he kept the family together - how

participant:  oh well . he . of course people .
 al~ always come forward.
 and offer to take .
 some of the children

interviewer:  yeah . how many of . how many were there ?

participant:   well there was five of us <five>
