# ${project.name} (${project.version})

Generates CSV files specificially for export/import of data for the
[trm-parser](https://github.com/connor-taylorbrown/trm-parser)
implemented by [Connor Talyor-Brown](https://github.com/connor-taylorbrown)
for MƒÅori data.

When serializing fragments, the following transformations are made:

- Vowels with umlauts or followed by a colon are macronized.
- English words are enclosed in square brackets.
- Utterances are split on full stops and pauses of 1000ms or longer,
  creating two fragments per utterance.

A CSV file is generated with the following columns:

- `Document` - the transcript ID.
- `Speaker` - the participant ID.
- `MatchId` - the MatchId-encoded identifier for the fragment.
- `ID` - the unique identifier for the fragment.
- `Original` - the original, unstandardized text of the fragment.
- `WithPauses` - the standardized fragment text with pause length (in seconds)
  between each token.
- `Terminator` - the reason for terminating the fragment, which can be:
  + `.` or `-` : there was a pause marker,
  + A number like `1.234` : there was an inter-token pause,
  + `utterance` : it was the end of the utterance, or
  + `turn` : it was the end of the speaker turn.
- `Fragment` - the standardized fragment text.
