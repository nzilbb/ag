[00:00.000 --> 00:10.320]  The rest of that side of the family, so he generously agreed that she could go with them,
[00:10.320 --> 00:14.240]  but there were so many people there that nothing was done constructively.
# New turn here:
[00:15.00 --> 00:15.240]  Right.
[00:15.240 --> 00:18.200]  Well, they just didn't get on to the interviews.
[00:18.200 --> 00:19.200]  There were no interviews.
[00:19.200 --> 00:20.200]  They all talked.
[00:20.200 --> 00:21.200]  Everybody talked.
[00:21.200 --> 00:22.200]  Everybody talked.
[00:22.200 --> 00:23.200]  Yeah.
[00:23.200 --> 00:24.560]  And just caught up to date.
[00:24.560 --> 00:25.560]  Yeah.
[00:25.560 --> 00:32.160]  And they wanted to go along just on a one to one basis and say, now, Nin, tell us about
[00:32.160 --> 00:38.980]  grandfather, you know, grandfather Pepper and how he built up his business, and tell
[00:38.980 --> 00:42.720]  us what you can remember of the house you used to live in, because Barry and I knew
[00:42.720 --> 00:45.360]  the house that they lived in, you know.
[00:45.360 --> 00:46.360]  Yeah.
[00:46.360 --> 00:51.760]  And he was a very, actually a very well to do builder in Wominui at that time.
[00:51.760 --> 01:01.400]  And Thelma Pepper was the oldest daughter of about, oh, I don't know, six children or
[01:01.400 --> 01:17.640]  seven, six or seven children, and she was fairly, what's the word, well, they were very
[01:17.640 --> 01:25.040]  correct family, and although they weren't very religious necessarily, I think they were
[01:25.040 --> 01:32.160]  Anglican maybe, and maybe they didn't really have an official religion or something, but
[01:32.160 --> 01:38.000]  of course Arthur Pepper and Fred were out of England.
[01:38.000 --> 01:47.200]  They'd come from England to establish whatever, their family and so on, and lived in New Zealand.
[01:47.200 --> 01:57.280]  Fred Pepper was a plumber guy, but had, he was a much, very much of an entrepreneur also
[01:57.280 --> 02:02.240]  and did things with barges on the Wominui River and all that sort of thing.
[02:02.240 --> 02:13.880]  And of course Arthur, who was our, Barry and I's grandfather, he was a, he was always a
[02:13.880 --> 02:19.760]  builder and had a very successful building company and had all his sons in it.
[02:19.760 --> 02:22.280]  Which is why Grandpop was a builder.
[02:22.280 --> 02:31.680]  And Grandpop did his trade not with Pepper but with the Wominui Session Door Company,
[02:31.680 --> 02:37.600]  and he was more of a, what I used to call, not a fitter and turner, but he was more of
[02:37.600 --> 02:45.320]  a cabinet maker, and then he worked, because he was impressed with Mother, he hung around
[02:45.320 --> 02:52.960]  for years, right through the Depression, and the Pepper parents were wealthy and here was
[02:52.960 --> 03:01.400]  a young fellow who rode a motorbike, which wasn't exactly the thing to be done, and he
[03:01.400 --> 03:06.820]  was chasing their eldest daughter with whom they were very proud, you see.
[03:06.820 --> 03:11.920]  And she sang, and she sang on the radio and did all sorts of interesting things in those
[03:11.920 --> 03:21.560]  days, and he, but he kept hanging around and the father took the girls, because of course
[03:21.560 --> 03:29.480]  there were three or four girls in the family, Mother Thelma was the eldest, he took them
[03:29.480 --> 03:36.400]  all to Fiji or somewhere for a long holiday trying to shake off this guy August Fromot.
[03:36.400 --> 03:46.480]  And, because August was a devout Catholic and had been bought up by a very strict French
[03:46.480 --> 03:52.560]  grandmother who was a devout Catholic, and he became a very devout Catholic himself of
[03:52.560 --> 04:01.000]  course, but they weren't all that keen about the Catholicism thing, and he had nothing,
[04:01.000 --> 04:03.580]  he had a motorbike and he didn't have anything else.
[04:03.580 --> 04:11.080]  He owned some property in the Patone foreshore, as he saved up some money he bought property,
[04:11.080 --> 04:15.620]  but during the Depression they were out of work and he couldn't keep the payments up,
[04:15.620 --> 04:18.200]  so he lost the property.
[04:18.200 --> 04:23.800]  And they grew potatoes on it, so he used to tell us just as a cash crop, you know.
[04:23.800 --> 04:31.920]  But of course he lost the property, and whatever he'd built up for himself as financial background,
[04:31.920 --> 04:40.280]  because he had nothing at all, and his own father died when he was five, Grandpop's father
[04:40.280 --> 04:46.560]  hadn't been killed in Malawi when he was five, and his grandmother bought him up, and the
[04:46.560 --> 04:55.280]  whole family was split up, and when the disaster happened again, because he'd had disaster
[04:55.280 --> 05:01.640]  after disaster in his family life, when his own wife was killed when he was fifty, the
[05:01.640 --> 05:11.180]  day he was fifty, then he refused to let any of the family be broken up, that was us.
[05:11.180 --> 05:31.800]  We were the oldest ones, of course I was seventeen, Barry was nineteen, and uh, he, she, Dad.
