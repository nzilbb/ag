    <p>This is an Annotation Graph API for linguistic annotations.</p>
    
    <p>Annotation Graphs are a data structure conceived by Steven Bird and Mark Liberman</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://lanl.arxiv.org/abs/cs/9907003">http://lanl.arxiv.org/abs/cs/9907003</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/PS_cache/cs/pdf/9903/9903003v1.pdf">http://xxx.lanl.gov/PS_cache/cs/pdf/9903/9903003v1.pdf</a></li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The structure is designed to be a tool-independent way of representing annotated
      linguistic data, and essentially defines an Annotation Graph as a directed acyclic
      graph where:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>nodes are 'anchors' that represent a point in time (in seconds) or a point in a
        text (in characters) (although the time/character offset label is optional), and</li> 
      <li>edges are 'annotations' which have a 'label' (the content of the annotation) and a
        'type' (the kind of annotation, analogous with an 'tier' or 'layer')</li> 
    </ul>

    <p>This particular implementation, which is used for </p>
      <a href="https://labbcat.canterbury.ac.nz">LaBB-CAT</a>,  developed by the
      <a href="http://www.nzilbb.canterbury.ac.nz">NZILBB</a>, includes extra features that
      allow tier hierarchies and parent/child constraints to be defined.  More details on
      extra features are available in 
      <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csl.2017.01.004">http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csl.2017.01.004</a>
    
    <p>An <q>annotation graph</q> represented by the
      <a href="javadoc/nzilbb/ag/Graph.html">Graph</a> class, and is
      a collection of
      <a href="javadoc/nzilbb/ag/Annotation.html">Annotation</a>s (edges)
      joined by
      <a href="javadoc/nzilbb/ag/Anchor.html">Anchor</a>s (nodes)
      which may or may not have temporal/character offsets. Superimposed over this
      temporally anchored graph is another heirarchical graph, where annotations are nodes
      and edges are child-to-parent links.
