<h2> Stanford Named Entity Recognizer</h2>

<p> Annotator that tags words that are recognized as being names according to the
  <a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/CRF-NER.html">
    Stanford Named Entity Recognizer (NER)</a> developed by the
  <a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/">Stanford Natural Language Processing Group</a>. </p>

<p> When this annotator is installed, it downloads models of version 4.2.0 of the
  Stanford Named Entity Recognizer (NER) from <a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/stanford-ner-4.2.0.zip">
    https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/stanford-ner-4.2.0.zip</a>, which requires

<p> Alternatively, it's possible to specify your own version of the tagger models at
  installation time.</p>
