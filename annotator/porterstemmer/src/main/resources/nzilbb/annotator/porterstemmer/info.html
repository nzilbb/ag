<h2>Porter Stemmer</h2>

<p> The Porter Stemmer annotator uses the Porter Algorithm to compute the stems of
  English words from their orthography. It achieves this by systematically stripping
  off or converting suffixes of word orthographies, in several passes, until a 'stem'
  remains, which is the same as the 'stem' for other forms of the same word. </p>

<p> It's important to realise that, in the words of M. F. Porter himself,
  <q> the suffixes are being removed simply to improve IR performance, and not as a
    linguistic exercise</q>.
  It doesn't get the stems 100% right.  It is pretty good for regular words, e.g.</p> 

<table>
  <tr><td> walk    </td> <td>&rarr;</td> <td> walk </td></tr>
  <tr><td> walks   </td> <td>&rarr;</td> <td> walk </td></tr>
  <tr><td> walked  </td> <td>&rarr;</td> <td> walk </td></tr>
  <tr><td> walking </td> <td>&rarr;</td> <td> walk </td></tr>
</table>

<p>&hellip;however, it behaves less well for irregular cases, e.g.</p>

<table>
  <tr><td> sing    </td> <td>&rarr;</td> <td>    sing     </td></tr>
  <tr><td> sings   </td> <td>&rarr;</td> <td>    sing     </td></tr>
  <tr><td> sang    </td> <td>&rarr;</td> <td><b> sang </b></td></tr>
  <tr><td> sung    </td> <td>&rarr;</td> <td><b> sung </b></td></tr>
  <tr><td> singing </td> <td>&rarr;</td> <td>    sing     </td></tr>
</table>

<p>However, it's also worth noting that it will do better than lexicon-based methods
  when it comes to new words, e.g.</p> 

<table>
  <tr><td> blog     </td> <td>&rarr;</td> <td> blog </td></tr>
  <tr><td> blogs    </td> <td>&rarr;</td> <td> blog </td></tr>
  <tr><td> blogging </td> <td>&rarr;</td> <td> blog </td></tr>
  <tr><td> blogged  </td> <td>&rarr;</td> <td> blog </td></tr>
</table>
