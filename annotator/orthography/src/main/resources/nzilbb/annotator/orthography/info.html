<h2>Orthography Standardizer</h2>

<p> The Orthography Standardizer annotator takes tokens from the word layer and
  'cleans up' their labels, creating tags on a new layer with standardized labels,
  which should be optimal for looking up lexicons, frequency computation, etc.
  Specifically: </p>

<ol>
  <li> the word label is converted to all lowercase, </li>
  <li> standardizes characters sometimes produced by word-processing software -
    e.g. em-dashes are converted to hyphens, 'smart-quote' apostrophes <tt> ’ </tt> are
    converted to plain apostrophes <tt> ' </tt>, etc.</li>
  <li> removes all punctuation characters <b> except: </b> <tt> ~ - ' : </tt> </li>
  <li> trailing apostrophes and hyphens are removed (leaving word-internal ones
    intact), and </li>
  <li> leading/trailing whitespace is trimmed off. </li>
</ol>

<p> For example: </p> 

<table style="margin: auto;">
  <tr><th> word   </th> <td> </td> <th> orthography </th></tr>
  <tr><td> “Why   </td> <td>→</td> <td> why </td></tr>
  <tr><td> hasn’t </td> <td>→</td> <td> hasn't </td></tr>
  <tr><td> Inés   </td> <td>→</td> <td> inés </td></tr>
  <tr><td> d~     </td> <td>→</td> <td> d~ </td></tr>
  <tr><td> got —  </td> <td>→</td> <td> got </td></tr>
  <tr><td> her    </td> <td>→</td> <td> her </td></tr>
  <tr><td> X—ray  </td> <td>→</td> <td> x-ray </td></tr>
  <tr><td> yet?”  </td> <td>→</td> <td> yet </td></tr>
</table>

<p> A second possible use for this annotator is to copy (and clean up) tokens from one
  layer to another, optionally filtering in or out tokens depending on whether they fall
  within the bounds of a third layer. Tokens that fall within annotation bounds can be
  included or excluded depending on the label of the filter layer annotation. e.g.
  word tokens can be copied to an output layer if they've been tagged as being in a
  specific language, or tokens can be copied but only when they're <i>not</i> tagged as
  being part of a reading passage, etc.</p>
