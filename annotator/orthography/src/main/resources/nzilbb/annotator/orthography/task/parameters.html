<h3>Orthography Standardizer</h3>

<p> The Orthography Standardizer annotator takes tokens from the word layer and
  'cleans up' their labels, creating tags on a new layer with standardized labels,
  which should be optimal for looking up lexicons, frequency computation,
  etc. </p>

<p> Configuration parameters are encoded as a JSON string, e.g. <br>
  <pre>{
    "tokenLayerId":"word",
    "lowerCase":"true",
    "replacements":{
      "\\s" : "",
      "’" : "'",
      "[“”]" : "\"",
      "—" : "-",
      "[\\p{Punct}&&[^-~:']]" : "",
      "^[-']+" : "",
      "[-']+$" : ""
    },
    "orthographyLayerId":"orthography"
}</pre>
</p>

<p> The parameters are: </p>
<dl>
  <dt> tokenLayerId </dt> <dd> Input layer from which raw word tokens are selected. </dd>
  <dt> tokenLayerId </dt> <dd> Input layer from which raw word tokens are selected. </dd>
  <dt> exactMatch</dt> <dd> "true" or "on" to ensure accented letters are always treated
    as distinct from  unaccented letters. When turned on, full-layer generation may be slower. </dd> 
  <dt> orthographyLayerId </dt> <dd> Output layer on which new annotations are added. </dd>
  <dt> replacements </dt> <dd> An object in which the keys are regular expressions to
    match and the values are what to replace the corresponding matches with. </dd>
  <dt> filters </dt> <dd> An optional object in which the keys are layer IDs and the values
    are regular expressions to match against labels of annotations on th given layer.
    Filters allow a set of annotations from other layer to include or exclude tokens.
    If the value for a given layer is empty string "", then all tokens that fall within the
    bounds of any annotation on that layer will be excluded from the output. If the value
    is any other string, it's a regular expression that's matched against the label of any
    annotations on that layer; if the expression matches the label, then tokens falling
    within the bounds of the annotation are included in the output, and all other tokens
    are excluded.</dd>
