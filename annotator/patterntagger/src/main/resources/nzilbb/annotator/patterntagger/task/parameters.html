<h3>Pattern Tagger</h3>

<p> This annotator generates new annotations by matching a list of regular expressions
  against annotations on a selected layer; the first pattern that matches is used to tag
  the annotation. </p> 

<p> Configuration parameters are encoded as a JSON string, e.g. <br>
  <pre>{
  "sourceLayerId":"word",
  "deleteOnNoMatch":"false",
  "destinationLayerId":"pause",
  "mappings":[
    {"pattern":"mm+","label":"mm"},
    {"pattern":"a+h+","label":"ah"}
  ]
}</pre>
</p>

<p> Parameters are: </p>
<dl>
  <dt> sourceLayerId </dt> <dd> Input layer from which matches for the regular expressions come. </dd>
  <dt> transcriptLanguageLayerId </dt> <dd> Transcript attribute for overall language, so the
    annotator can avoid tagging transcripts in the wrong language.
    (Only applicable if sourceLayerId is a word layer.)</dd>
  <dt> phraseLanguageLayerId </dt> <dd> Layer for annotating phrases in a different
    language, so the annotator can avoid tagging word tokens in the wrong language.
    (Only applicable if sourceLayerId is a word layer.)</dd> 
  <dt> destinationLayerId </dt> <dd> This is the layer that new annotations will be added to. </dd>
  <dt> mappings </dt> <dd> an ordered list of regular expressions to match against, 
    and what the label should be if matched.
    If both your sourceLayerId and destinationLayerId identify are word layers, these patterns
    will be applied to each word individually.
    If sourceLayerId identifies a word layer and your destinationLayerId identifies a
    phrase (or span) layer, these patterns will be applied to the words concatenated together with
    intervening spaces, one speaker-turn at a time (or for the whole transcript if
    destinationLayerId is a span layer).
    This is an array of JSON objects with the following attributes: <ul>
      <li><q>pattern</q> - The regular expression to try to match.</li>
      <li><q>label</q> - The label to use if the pattern matches. This can include
        'captured group' expressions like <tt>$1</tt> to copy parts of the matched source label,
        or it can copy a label from a different layer - e.g. "Copy from layer: orthography" will
        result in the label being the same as what's on the orthography layer for this token.</li></ul></dd> 
  <dt> deleteOnNoMatch </dt> <dd> boolean setting for whether any existing annotation on the
    target layer should be deleted. </dd>
</dl>

<h4> Examples </h4>

<p>Tag filled pauses like "um", "ah", "er", etc. on a word layer called "pause":</p>
  <pre>{
  "sourceLayerId":"orthography",
  "deleteOnNoMatch":"false",
  "destinationLayerId":"pause",
  "mappings":[
    {"pattern":"[ua]+h*m+","label":"um"},
    {"pattern":"e+r*m+","label":"um"},
    {"pattern":"mm+","label":"mm"},
    {"pattern":"e+r+","label":"er"},
    {"pattern":"a+h+","label":"ah"}
  ]
}</pre>

<p>Copy any pronunciation tags from the "pronounce" word layer to the "phonemes" word layer,
without deleting any other phoneme tags that might already be there:</p>
<pre>{
  "sourceLayerId":"pronounce",
  "destinationLayerId":"phonemes",
  "deleteOnNoMatch":false,
  "mappings":[
    {"pattern":".*","label":"$0"}
  ]
}</pre>

<p>Annotate the 'fairy story' portion of a transcript -
  i.e. the section starting "once upon a time" and ending "happily ever after" -
  by adding an annotation labelled "story" to a span layer called "fairyStory"".</p>
<pre>{
  "sourceLayerId":"orthography",
  "destinationLayerId":"fairyStory",
  "deleteOnNoMatch":true,
  "mappings":[
  {"pattern":"once upon a time .* happily ever after","label":"story"}
  ]
}</pre>

<p>Annotate groups of words that make up syntactically complete 'c-units' based on the
  punctuation mark used to terminate them, on a phrase layer called "CUnit".</p>
<pre>{
  "sourceLayerId":"word",
  "destinationLayerId":"CUnit",
  "deleteOnNoMatch":true,
  "mappings":[
  {"pattern":".*?([.?>^])","label":"$1"}
  ]
}</pre>
