<h2>Unisyn Tagger</h2>

<p>The Unisyn Tagger tags word tokens with data from
  <a href="http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/unisyn/">Unisyn</a>,
  a lexicon produced by the Centre for Speech Technology Research at the University of Edinburgh.</p> 

<p>Unisyn is a 'master lexicon' of English, which contains:</p>
<ul>
  <li>orthography</li>
  <li>part-of-speech</li>
  <li>pronunciation, in an 'accent neutral' form</li>
  <li>'enriched orthography' showing morphological information</li>
  <li>frequency, as derived from various sources, including the British National Corpus, Time articles, Gutenberg, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>The pronunciations in the lexicon can be converted into an accent-specific form using
  perl scripts that are included with the lexicon. </p> 

<h3 id="getting">Getting Unisyn</h3>

<p>Unisyn is available under a non-commercial license, and must be acquired seperately
  from this layer manager. To acquire Unisyn, you must first register on the the Unisyn
  website and accept the terms of their license.  The Unisyn website is here:<br/> 
  <a href="http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/unisyn/">http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/unisyn/</a>
</p> 

<p>(This layer manager has been tested with version 1.3 of Unisyn)</p>

<h3 id="using">Using Unisyn with this annotator</h3>

<p>Once you've got Unisyn, you can use it to produce accent-specific lexicons, and provide
  these lexicons to the annotator, which then uses them to tag word tokens in your transcripts.</p> 

<p>For example, if you want to annotate your transcripts with 'General American English' pronunciations:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Generate the General American English (<i>gam</i>) lexicon by running the following Unisyn commands:
    <ol>
      <li><code>get-exceptions.pl -a gam -f unilex &gt; gam.1</code></li>
      <li><code>post-lex-rules.pl -a gam -f gam.1 &gt; gam.2</code></li>
      <li><code>map-unique.pl -a gam -f gam.2 &gt; gam.unisyn</code></li>
    </ol>
    This gives you the file <samp>gam.unisyn</samp>, which is the lexicon file you need for the next step.
  </li>
  <li>Create the layer for your pronunciation annotations</li>
  <li>Upload the accent-specific lexicon on the layer configuration page</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="mapping">Mapping Unisyn pronunciations to the DISC phoneme set</h3>

<p>Some processing of phonological layers assumes that the annotations use the DISC phoneme set
  designed for the CELEX phonemic transcriptions.  This set is used because each phoneme is
  expressed by precisely one ASCII character, including phonemes usually expressed using a
  digraph - e.g. affricates like <code>/t&#x0283;/</code> (which is <code>/J/</code> in
  DISC) and diphthongs like <code>/a&#x026A;/</code> (which is <code>/2/</code> in
  DISC)</p> 

<p>Unisyn transcriptions use a set of phones that is greater that the set of phones
  available in DISC, and the transcriptions are designed to be broadly phonetic, not
  phonemic.</p> 

<p>This means that using the DISC representation of the transcripts is imperfect, as there
  is a certain amount of loss of information when mapping Unisyn phones to DISC
  phonemes.</p> 

<p>If having the original transcriptions precisely as defined in the Unisyn lexicon is
  very important, you can instead create a layer that uses the original transcription as
  contained in the file you uploaded. This has the advantage that the transcriptions are
  not filtered through the above mapping, and the disadvantage that LaBB-CAT won't be able
  to display the transcriptions using IPA symbols, nor help you when creating search
  patterns for the layer. </p> 

<p>If you decide to do this, Unisyn offers you two possible representations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Unisyn transcriptions - e.g. <samp>{ p r @ . n ~ uh n s $}.&lt; ii . * ei . sh n!&lt;</samp>
    - these are already present in the file that you generated if you followed the
    instructions above (i.e. <samp>gam.unisyn</samp>)</li> 
  <li>SAM-PA transcriptions - e.g. <samp>pr\@%nVns$i"e$Sn=$@5</samp> - these can be
    obtained by running an extra Unisyn command, and uploading the
    resulting <samp>gam.sampa</samp> file: 
    <br/><code>output-sam.pl -a gam -f gam.unisyn &gt; gam.sampa</code>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>(Unisyn has a third script called <code>output-ipa.pl</code> which produces
  transcriptions for displaying in HTML -
  e.g. <samp>p&amp;#633;&amp;#601;&amp;#716;n&amp;#652;ns.i&amp;#712;e.&amp;#643;n
    &amp;#809</samp> - which are not suitable for search, analysis, or
  forced-alignment)</p> 

<p>In order to prevent the DISC mapping from applying on your layer:</p>
<ul>
  <li>When creating the layer, set the layer type to <i>Text</i> rather than <i>Phonological</i>.</li>
  <li>When configuring the layer, set the field to <i>Phonemes (original file)</i> rather than <i>Phonemes (DISC)</i>.</li>
</ul>
