    <p> This annotator creates a mapping between the labels of a pair of layers, by finding the
      minimum edit path between them. If any <i>sub-mappings</i> have been configured - where two
      pairs of layers are mapped, two word layers and two corresponding phone layers -
      these mappings are tracked in detail so that alignments and label assignments can be
      compared. </p>
    <p> This page provides access to tracked sub-mapping information, including raw
      mapping data and summary information including mean <i>Overlap Rate</i>. </p>
    <details><summary> <i>Overlap Rate</i> is a value between 0 and 1. A value of 0 means that the
        two intervals do not overlap at all, with 1 meaning they completely
        overlap. </summary>

        devised Overlap Rate (OvR) to compare alignments, which measures how
        much two intervals overlap, independent of their absolute durations. OvR is
        calculated as follows: </p>

      <div class="formula">
        OÎ½R =
        <span class="division">
          <span class="numerator"> CommonDur <span class="for-copy-paste">/</span> </span>
          <span class="denominator"> DurMax </span>
        </span>
        = 
        <span class="division">
          <span class="numerator"> CommonDur <span class="for-copy-paste">/</span> </span>
          <span class="denominator"><span class="for-copy-paste">(</span>DurRef + DurAuto - CommonDur<span class="for-copy-paste">)</span></span>
        </span>
      </div>
      
      <p> The result is a value between 0 and 1. A value of 0 means that the two intervals
        do not overlap at all, with 1 meaning they completely overlap (i.e., the
        alignments exactly agree). Overlap Rate has several advantages over comparing
        start/end offsets directly: </p>
      <ol>
        <li> It provides a single result, with no need to specify different thresholds for
          offset accuracy. </li>
        <li> It gives a measure of how time-spans (rather than time-points) align, and
          these time-spans correspond directly to what is usually the primary unit of
          interest: phones. </li>
        <li> It ensures that a small absolute discrepancy in alignment is more serious for
          short intervals than for longer ones. </li>
      </ol>
