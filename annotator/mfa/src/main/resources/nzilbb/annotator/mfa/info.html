    <h1>MFA</h1>
    
    <p> The MFA annotator integrates with the
      <a href="https://montrealcorpustools.github.io/Montreal-Forced-Aligner/">
        Montreal Forced Aligner</a>, which can use words with phonemic transcriptions, and
      the corresponding audio, to force-align words and phones; i.e. determine the start
      and end time of each speech sound within each word, and thus the start/end times
      of the words. </p>

    <p> The annotator can work in two modes: </p>
    <ol>
      <li> <b>Train and Align</b> - acoustic models are trained on the data you want to
        align, which can be in any language as long as you have a pronunciation
        dictionary for it. </li>
      <li> <b>Pre-trained Models/Dictionaries</b> - pre-trained models and pronunciation
        dictionaries are supplied by the Montreal Forced Aligner and used for forced
        alignment. A list of languages for which dictionaries are available is here:
        <a href="https://montreal-forced-aligner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/models/dictionary.html#pretrained-dictionaries">
          https://montreal-forced-aligner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/models/dictionary.html#pretrained-dictionaries</a>
      </li>
    </ol>
    
    <p> The Montreal Forced Aligner third-party tool developed by Michael McAuliffe and others
      for time aligning orthographic and phonological forms from a pronunciation
      dictionary to orthographically transcribed audio files. It is based on the
      <a href="http://kaldi-asr.org/"> Kaldi ASR toolkit</a>.
    </p>

    <p> This annotator cannot install the Montreal Forced Aligner. You must manually
      install it following the installation instructions:
