      <summary> This annotator partitions annotation into blocks of
        either a given number of tokens, or a given number of
        seconds. The annotation label of each block is the number of
        tokens (or seconds) in that block. </summary> 
      
      <p> For example, it can be used to mark blocks of 100 words long, from
        the beginning of each turn, or mark the middle 300 words of each
        topic tag. Leftover tokens can optionally be annotated or not.  The
        label of each block is the number of tokens in it, so leftover
        blocks can be distinguished from full blocks. </p>

      <p>The settings:</p>
      
      <dl>
        <dt>Partition Boundary Layer</dt>
        <dd>The Partition Boundary Layer defines which annotations
          will act as the outer bounds of the partitions. This layer already
          contains tokens on the <em>Count</em> layer (below) which will be
          counted for partitioning.</dd>
        <dt>Partition Alignment</dt>
        <dd>Partitions will be created within each annotation on
          the <em>Partition Boundary Layer</em> (above), starting from
          the start, middle, or end of each annotation. If <q>Start</q>
          is selected, the first token in each <em>Partition
            Boundary</em> annotation will also be the first token of a
          partition. If <q>End</q> is selected, the last token in
          each <em>Partition Boundary</em> annotation will also be the
          last token of a partition. If <q>Middle</q> is selected,
          partitions are generated from the middle of each
          <em>Partition Boundary</em> annotation outward.</dd> 
        <dt>Count</dt>
        <dd>Annotations on this layer will be counted in order to
        group them into partitions. You can also create time-based
        annotations (e.g. an interval every 5 seconds) by selecting
        the <q>[seconds]</q> option.</dd> 
        <dt>Partition Size</dt>
        <dd>This is the number of annotations on the <em>Count</em>
          layer which will make up each partition, or if you
          select <q>[seconds]</q> as the unit to <em>Count</em>, then
          this is the number of seconds length for each partition.</dd> 
        <dt>Number of Partitions</dt>
        <dd>This optional setting specifies the maximum number of
          partitions for each <em>Partition Boundary</em> annotation
          (including left-overs - see below).  For example, if you want
          only the middle <var>n</var> tokens, you would set this 1 (and
          set <em>Alignment</em> to <q>Middle</q>).  If left blank, the
          maximum possible number of full partitions will be created for
          each <em>Partition Boundary</em> annotation.</dd> 
        <dt>Annotate Left-overs</dt>
        <dd>Once all the required partitions
          containing <em>Partition-Size</em> tokens have been created,
          there are likely to be some remaining tokens left over, which
          have not been included in a partition.  If you tick
          the <em>Annotate Left-overs</em> option, then these remaining
          tokens will also be annotated, making the configuration
          consistent with the set-theoretic definition of a partition
          (i.e. including all elements of the superset) and introducing
          the possibility of partitions that contain fewer
          than <em>Partition-Size</em> tokens (which can be
          differentiated by the partition label).</dd> 
        <dt> Include Transcripts By </dt> <dd> In order to skip
          annotation of certain transcripts, e.g. you may wish to not
          partitition word-list or reading-passage transcripts,
          specify the ID of a transcript attribute layer that can be
          used to exclude or include transcripts for
          partitioning. e.g. to exclude transcripts on the basis of
          the <tt>transcript_type</tt> attribute, select
          the <q>transcript_type</q> layer. <br>
          This will result in a list of transcript types appearing below, and
          you can then un-tick the types you want to exclude from partitioning.
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <h3> Examples </h3>
      
      <p> For example, if you want to mark blocks of 100 words long,
        from the beginning of each turn, you would use the following
        configuration: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Partition Boundary Layer: turn</li>
        <li>Partition Alignment: Start</li>
        <li>Count: orthography</li>
        <li>Partition Size: 100</li>
        <li>Number of Partitions: (blank)</li>
        <li>Annotate Left-overs: ticked</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p> Alternatively, to mark the middle 300 words of each topic
        tag, you would use the following configuration: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Partition Boundary Layer: topic</li>
        <li>Partition Alignment: Middle</li>
        <li>Count: orthography</li>
        <li>Partition Size: 300</li>
        <li>Number of Partitions: 1</li>
        <li>Annotate Left-overs: unticked</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p> Alternatively, to mark blocks of 5 seconds long, from the
        beginning of each turn, you would use the following configuration: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Partition Boundary Layer: turn</li>
        <li>Partition Alignment: Start</li>
        <li>Count: [seconds]</li>
        <li>Partition Size: 5</li>
        <li>Number of Partitions: (blank)</li>
        <li>Annotate Left-overs: ticked</li>
      </ul>
