<h1>Partitioner</h1>

<p> This annotator partitions tokens into blocks of a given size. </p>

<p> For example, it can be used to mark blocks of 100 words long, from
  the beginning of each turn, or mark the middle 300 words of each
  topic tag. Leftover tokens can optionally be annotated or not.  The
  label of each block is the number of tokens in it, so leftover
  blocks can be distinguished from full blocks. </p>
