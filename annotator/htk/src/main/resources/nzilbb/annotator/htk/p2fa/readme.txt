Penn Phonetics Lab Forced Aligner Toolkit (P2FA)

============================================================

A. Introduction
---------------

The Penn Phonetics Lab Forced Aligner (P2FA) is an automatic phonetic 
alignment toolkit based on HTK. It contains the acoustic models of 
American English, a Python script that can be used to do forced 
alignment, as well as this readme file and some examples. There is 
also an online processing system on the P2FA website with which you 
can submit a WAV file and transcript and get back a Praat TextGrid 
file by email.

The acoustic models included in the toolkit are GMM-based monophone 
HMMs. Each HMM state has 32 Gaussian mixture components on 39 PLP 
coefficients. Separate models were created for speech sampled at 8 KHz, 
11,025 Hz, and 16 KHz. The acoustic model includes a robust short-pause 
("sp") HMM inserted optionally between words which greatly improves
alignment accuracy.

B. Included in the Toolkit
--------------------------

./models/: The acoustic models, parameter files, and CMU 
pronunciation dictionary;

./align.py: a python script that automates the procedure of doing 
forced alignment, creating a Praat TextGrid file from a WAV file and 
an orthographic transcript;

./test/: files for testing the Toolkit;

./examples/: the example files.

C. Prerequisites
----------------

You will need the HTK toolkit version 3.4 already installed to do forced 
alignment. HTK can be found at http://htk.eng.cam.ac.uk/. Only version
3.4 is supported by the align.py script. The newer version 3.4.1 has
a problem aligning the 'sp' model.

You need to have Python 2.5/2.6 (earlier/later versions have not been tested)
for the align.py script.

D. Using align.py
-----------------

1. Run "python align.py wavfile trsfile output_file". If you are not
   running align.py from the toolkit directory, you will need to
   specify its path.
   
   wavfile is the path to a WAV file containing the audio to be 
   aligned. If it was not sampled at one of the three sampling
   rates used for the acoustic models, it will be automatically
   resampled to 11,025 Hz. This sampling rate is recommended.
   
   trsfile is a text file containing the transcript. Spaces or newlines 
   should separate words. If a word is not found in the CMU pronouncing 
   dictionary, an error will occur, but you can edit the file model/dict 
   and add new pronunciations as needed. You may include the following 
   labels in the transcript: '{SL}' for silence, '{LG}' for laughter, 
   '{NS}' for noise, '{CG}' for cough, '{BR}' for breath, and '{LS}' for 
   lipsmack.
   
   output_file is a Praat TextGrid file containing the rest of
   the forced alignment.

   The toolkit contains example files for testing. You can align
   the test files with:
   
   python align.py ./test/BREY00538.wav ./test/BREY00538.txt \
       ./test/BREY00538.TextGrid

   (the slash denotes that the single line is supposed to continue
    unbroken)
    
   The output file may contain 'sp' intervals between words where
   there was a pause.

2. If you have more than one file to align, you can write a shell 
   script and call align.py in a loop. You can also follow the 
   instructions below.

3. Several command-line options can also be included. They must
   precede the specification of the WAV file. They are:

  	-r sampling_rate	override which sample rate model to use,
  						one of 8000, 11025, and 16000. The default
  						is the sampling rate of the WAV file if it
  						is one of the three, otherwise 11025.
	-s start_time		start of portion of wavfile to align (in
						seconds, default 0)
	-e end_time			end of portion of wavfile to align (in seconds,
						defaul to end)

E. Doing Forced Alignment The Hard Way
--------------------------------------

1. Please refer to the files under ./examples/ for the right
   formats for the files described in the next steps.

2. Prepare speech files and their word transcription as described 
   below. You can do forced alignment for very long speech files (e.g., 
   one hour), or you can also align many files in one step.

3. Create the reference transcription file, transcript.mlf. 
   transcript.mlf is a HTK "master label file" containing the 
   transcripts of all the files to be force-aligned. Below are the steps 
   to generate the file:

    I. Capitalize all the letters of the words. If a word doesnâ€™t 
    appear in the CMU pronunciation dictionary, you can either 
    manually add it to the dictionary or exclude it from forced 
    alignment, depending on your goal. The alignment will fail if 
    there is an unknown word in transcript.mlf.

    II. You may include the following labels in transcript.mlf: 
    '{SL}' for silence, '{LG}' for laughter, '{NS}' for noise, 
    '{CG}' for cough, '{BR}' for breath, and '{LS}' for lipsmack.

    III. You may want to insert an 'sp' between every two words. 'sp' 
    stands for small pause. It can have zero length (no pause) from 
    forced alignment.

4. Create code.scp and test.scp. They contain the names of the files 
   to be coded and aligned respectively.

5. Extract acoustic features:
                 
   HCopy -T 1 -C ./models/your-sampling-rate/config -S code.scp

   The file config contains parameter settings for the speech files 
   (.wav, .raw, sampling rate, etc.) and for the acoustic features 
   (mfcc, plp, etc.). If your speech files have a different sampling 
   rate other than 8,000Hz, 11,025Hz, or 16,000Hz, you can downsample 
   or upsample to 11,025 Hz (which by far has the best performance). 
   In our training procedure, we downsampled from 44,100 Hz to the 
   target sampling rate using 'sox -polyphase'.

6. Forced alignment:

   HVite -T 1 -a -m -I transcript.mlf -H ./model/your-sampling-rate/macros -H ./model/your-sampling-rate/hmmdefs -S test.scp -i ./align.mlf -p 0.0 -s 5.0 ./model/dict ./model/monophones

   align.mlf is the forced alignment results. You can convert it to 
   label files, e.g., Praat TextGrids. Please note that: a) the time 
   unit in align.mlf is 100 ns (0.00000001 second); b) there is a 
   rounding issue when the sampling rate is 11,025 Hz and the time 
   step is 10 milliseconds, so you need to correct the time stamps in 
   alilgn.mlf. You can use the following formula to convert the time 
   stamp x into seconds:
        y = (x/10000000 + 0.0125)*(11000/11025).
