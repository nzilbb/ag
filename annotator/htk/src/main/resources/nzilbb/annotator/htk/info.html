<h2>HTK Aligner</h2>

<p> The HTK Aligner can use words with phonemic transcriptions, and the
  corresponding audio, to force-align words and phones; i.e. determine the start and
  end time of each speech sound within each word, and thus the start/end times of the
  words. </p>

<p> The Hidden Markov Model Toolkit (HTK) is a speech recognition toolkit developed at
  Cambridge University. It is a set of programs that can be used to build speech
  recognition systems. Part of the process of building such systems involves
  force-aligning training data â€“ i.e. automatically lining up phonemic-transcriptions of
  known words with the audio signal in the training recordings. The HTK Aligner takes
  advantage of this capability to facilitate forced-alignment for your
  transcripts. </p>

<p> HTK is not free software in the "GNU" sense - i.e. we can not distribute it with
  HTK Aligner, instead you have to download it yourself from the Cambridge University
  website. However it is free in the "no cost" sense, you just need to register on 
  the HTK website, and you can then download and use HTK free of charge.  </p>

<p> Under most circumstances, you will have to: </p>
<ol>
  <li> Register at <a href="http://htk.eng.cam.ac.uk/register.shtml">http://htk.eng.cam.ac.uk/register.shtml</a></li>
  <li> Download the version of HTK that is appropriate for the computer that HTK Aligner
    is to be installed on:
    <ul>
      <li> For Windows systems, there are pre-compiled .exe files that you can
        download. </li>
      <li> For Unix-like systems including OS X, you need to download the source code,
        which you will then install following the provided instructions. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> Unzip (for Windows) or compile and install (for Unix-like systems downloaded
    files on the computer that HTK Aligner is to be installed on. </li> 
</ol>

  Proceedings of Acoustics '08.) are included with this annotator, and may
  optionally be used for alignment. This option can only be successfully used for audio
  in English, but achieves better alignment for short recordings (less than five
  minutes). </p>
